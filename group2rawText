'AW&ST  had a brief blurb on a Manned Lunar Exploration confernce May 7th  at Crystal City Virginia under the auspices of AIAA.  Does anyone know more about this?  How much
'Mark Prado       Old pioneer song from the 1850\'s or so goes as follows:      In a cavern in a canyon    Excavating for a mine    Dwelt a miner forty-niner    And his daughter CLEMENTINE    Chorus:   Oh my darling Oh my darling    Oh my darling Clementine.    You are lost and gone forever    Oh my darling Clementine.     I\'ve also had it explained (but not confirmed from a reliable data source) that CLEMENTINE is an acronym.  Something like Combined Lunar Elemental Mapper Experiment on Extended Non Terrestrial Intercept Near Earth.  Personally
' Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric Earth orbit doing lunar flybys and then was inserted into lunar orbit using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  This meant that it would crash on the Moon eventually since there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows)
'a  What about positional uncertainties in S-L 1993e?   I assume we know where and what Galileo is doing within a few meters.   But without the HGA  don\'t we have to have some pretty good ideas of where to look before imaging?  If the HGA was working  they could slew around in near real time (Less speed of light delay).  But when they were imaging toutatis????  didn\'t someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images?     Also I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will that affect the other imaging missions.  with the LGA  there is a real tight allocation of bandwidth.   It may be premature to hope for answers

'<stuff deleted>  You mean like: seconds minutes hours days months years. . .  :-)  Remember  the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale.  Some revisionists tell the history something like this:  The coldest point in a particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body temperature of a volunteer (turns out he was sick but you can\'t win \'em all). Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into hundredths. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t:-)  FWIW

'Here are some recent observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope:       o The Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was used to make ultraviolet        observations of both the planet Pluto and its moon Charon. The        peakups were successful. The observations were executed as        scheduled and no problems were reported.       o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet        Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These        observations will help in our understanding of the planet\'s        atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred        close to the last quarter moon and special arrangements had to be        made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.        The observations are currently being reviewed
'  How could this possibly be environmental vandalism when there is no environment to vandalize up there?  Since the advertising is just to help defray costs it\'s certainly no surprise that the taxpayers would bear most of the expense.  Sounds like a good idea to me since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the expense if they didn\'t do the advertising.   Great idea they should have done it long ago.   I can\'t believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day but nobody complains about that.  Besides it\'s in LEO so it would only be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright and even if it would have some miniscule impact it would be only for a short time as it goes zipping across the sky.   No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about so it would be no surprise.   Well look on the er
' Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a standby mode for use in an emergency.  In that case however the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally Pat\'s explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money)
'Are breathable liquids possible?  I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was touched upon (it might have been some other TV show).  If nothing else I know such liquids ARE possible because...  They showed a large glass full of this liquid and put a white mouse (rat?) in it.  Since the liquid was not dense the mouse would float so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.  Now this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations

' You\'re assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize it is *cheaper* to develop your own launch system charging its entire development cost against your contest entry than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No other demand is necessary.   You\'re assuming that it\'s going to take a decade to build a new launch system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years depending on exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want speed
'Yes the Phobos mission did return some useful data including images of Phobos itself. The best I\'ve seen had a surface resolution of about 40 meters.

'Just a pointer to the article in the current Science News article on Federal R&D funding.  Very briefly
'I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that  every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors were slower then  existent single processors.  What the argument was though was that these new technologies promised either theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.  I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.  ELV\'s can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT  but  an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.  This is kind of a speculative posting

'All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year  moon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace  development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of  Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.  If memory serves the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally  reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as  Fokker\'s Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh  ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.  But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to  realize that much more was at stake than $25
'Sterrenkundig symposium \'Compacte Objecten\'                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643 zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz de eerste waarnemer en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht vieren de benoeming van hun \'oervader\' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten \'compacte objecten\' de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen als alles goed gaat de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren een zogeheten pulsar in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4- (exclusief lunch) en f 16- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I Universiteit Utrecht.

' Great speculation - I remember being proud on behalf of all the free world (you think that way when you are seven years old) that we had got there first.

Perhaps stretching to match US efforts would have destabilized them sooner than it did in fact - and in the tradition of Marvel Comics \'What If\' this destabilization in the Brezhnev era might have triggered the third world war.

I don\'t know what a low grade fusion reactor is but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so on average (more in some fractions but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo\'s claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall Wingo wasn\'t content with being assured that titanium (at .5\% in the Earth\'s crust average) would not run out and touted lunar mines even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon titanium occurs in basalts; high-Ti basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14\% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3\% TiO2 frequently have 4\% and sometimes even 5\% TiO2 (again by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers scattered all over the world (Siberia Brazil the NW United States Ethiopia etc.).  If even 1\% of the basalts are 5\% TiO2 this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer but less common
' Could it be Public Missile Inc in Michigan?  From the description of ad here it sounds like they\'re talking about High Power Rocketry an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week weekend etc.) at a designated site and time and all of the launches are then covered under this blanket waiver. There is also a High Power Safety Code which designates more specific rules such as launch field size etc.  Finally in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and safe flight at a total impulse level.  For more information

'I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in the back.  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe science or questionablely legal but this one really grabbed my attention. It was from a company name Personal Missle Inc. or something like that.  Anyhow the ad stated that they\'d sell rockets that were up to 20\' in length and engines of sizes F to M.  They also said that some rockets will reach 50000 feet.  Now aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one of these beasts isn\'t this illegal?  I can\'t imagine the FAA allowing people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.

'Ethnocentric USian that I am I\'ve assumed that we and the xUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to track non-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of  databases recently  I found that Japan has some optical capabilities along this line and also uses a radar designed for other purposes for orbital debris surveys (it isn\'t clear whether the radar can  determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). Abstracts of  the articles are appended.        This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than  the US Russia and Japan do space surveillance and if so how and  why?

The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <---- station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described.

HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON      Official names are decided by committees of the International     Astronomical Union and are not for sale. There are purely commercial     organizations which will for a fee send you pretty certificates and     star maps describing where to find your star. These organizations have     absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they     assign are not used by anyone else. It\'s also likely that you won\'t be     able to see your star without binoculars or a telescope.

Bussard Journal of \tPropulsion and Power Vol. 6 No. 5 Sept.-Oct. 1990  \t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion \t    systems with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the \t    thrust-power gain G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values \t    of conventional (solar fission) electric propulsion systems are \t    always quite small (e.g. G(t)<0.8). With these high-thrust \t    interplanetary flight is not possible because system \t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local \t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast gain values 50-100 \t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts which offer \t    high-thrust flight capability. One performance example shows a \t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast) one-way transit time with \t    19\% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows \t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in \t    Earth/moon space.  \tThe QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for \tAerospace Flight Propulsion by Robert W.

Koloc Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion \tEnergy special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY March 1989.  \t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron \t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times \t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma \t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds \t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels then high power densities \t    and very compact realtively clean burning engines for space and \t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm \t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure \t    efficient structure exceptional stability fluid-mechanically \t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power \t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens \t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the \t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages \t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I \t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob \t    Hirsch the primary proponent of the Tokamak has recently \t    declared Koloc\'s PLASMAKtm precursor the spheromak to be one \t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather \t    than Tokamak.

'Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):  There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its rings in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here\'s some information about the events and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn\'s rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21 (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus\' orbit.  Because the Sun\'s size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it\'s unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992) Astronomy and Astrophysics 265 L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia   etc.  Unfortunately the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that\'s looking for something   to do?  I\'d be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it\'s not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse so you\'ll need a big telescope that\'s a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don\'t   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India
' Wishful thinking mostly. It\'s more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch  and it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military weapons systems but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become but that\'s a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent calcium loss muscle atrophy and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials heatsink and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements and volatile compounds and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now the seafloors and we virtually ignore Antarctica a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries if not much longer.  Luna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough

'Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com) mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS MARS & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1 the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the     onboard computer took control. However there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression R-dot-bar sub n (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3 launched on November 5 1964 was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun\'s energy for power from its solar     panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4 the sister probe to MARINER 3 did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a dead world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2 plus the information     that Venus\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth\'s or the equivalent of being 3300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a dead planet first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9 the sister probe to MARINER 8 became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars\' two small moons Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON SUN VENUS JUPITER and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11 1958 PIONEER 2 on November 8 and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960 a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6 7     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3 launched on January 26 1962 was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4 launched April 23 1962 had the same purpose as RANGER 3 but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5 launched October 18 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4 lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7     the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral Florida on August 20 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not) and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\' sky was     pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7 1980 when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13 1982 an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again despite the     engineers\' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9 1975 and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7 1976. The lander touched down on September 3 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978 which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5 1977 and flew past Jupiter on March     5 1979 and by Saturn on November 13 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20 1977 (before VOYAGER 1) and flew by Jupiter on August 7     1979 by Saturn on August 26 1981 by Uranus on January 24 1986 and     by Neptune on August 8 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could in principle have headed towards Pluto     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes our knowledge of the 4 giant planets their     satellites and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids     kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus Neptune was found to have rather active weather     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings and 6 other satellites were     discovered. Neptune\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\'s liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon Venus and     Mars I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959 missed Moon and became first \t     craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was \t     also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966 returned images \t     from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 \t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were \t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil \t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in \t      1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\'s \t      surface LUNOKHOD 1 in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished \t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in \t      1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions \t       lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with \t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in \t       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. \t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe \t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending \t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before \t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles \t       similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet \t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in \t       1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the \t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar \t       mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. \t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of \t\tplanet\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian \t     atmosphere in 1985 including two landers. Flyby buses went on \t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in \t     March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased \t     enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian \t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian \t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red \t     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface but lander \t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974 braking rockets failed to \t     fire probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission orbiting Mars in \t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. \t     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974 went into a solar orbit \t     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\' largest \t       moon Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to \t       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did \t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989 but signals ceased one week \t       before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter Saturn and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon     Mars Venus and various comets have been planned for the 1990s and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985 and approached Halley\'s Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind all of     which work normally now so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\'s. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\'s radius)) and the third     October 28 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN a small lunar probe was launched into Earth orbit on January 24     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19 where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft Hagoromo remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19 but the spacecraft\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\'s atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\'s surface (35.3N 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:  \tApoapsis Altitude: about 49400 km \tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9600 km \tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) \tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works categorized in three     groups: General overviews specific books on particular space missions     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\'s     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn the RANGER     SURVEYOR LUNAR ORBITER and APOLLO missions to Luna the MARINER     missions to Mercury Venus and Mars the VIKING probes to Mars and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune.      More details on American Soviet European and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE ASTRONOMY SCIENCE NATURE and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME NEWSWEEK and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical THE PLANETARY REPORT details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society 65 North Catalina Avenue     Pasadena California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible

'Forwarded from: PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PASADENA CALIF. 91109. (818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth\'s ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways said Dr. Jim Margitan principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite he continued.  The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities as well as data that is useful in its own right.       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime and following a three- hour ascent the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements Margitan explained and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility normally based in Palestine Tex. operating under a contract from NASA\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic and are 790000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1300 and 1800 kilograms (3000 and 4000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1300 kilograms (3
' I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes. So if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on  hold or else!! That\'s about it. Remember a liquid is several more times as dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 I think

' The face is an accident of light and shadow.  There are many faces in landforms on Earth; none is artificial (well excluding Mount Rushmore and the like...).  There is also a smiley face on Mars and a Kermit The Frog.  The question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is not quite closed although the odds are against it and the most that the more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.  There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.   Mars Observer currently approaching Mars will probably try to get a better image or two of the face at some point.  It\'s not high priority; nobody takes it very seriously.  The shadowed half of the face does not look very face-like

' I haven\'t seen any speculation about it. But the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)  was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven\'t heard which won except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the  successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won but this is a guess nothing is very clear in  Russia. I\'m sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue  their development.   The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so that\'s a good fit for their existing upper stage the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don\'t know about launch loads etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB\'s probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?    They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built) and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities


'This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..  I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard walls...  Why not do the same thing for a space station..  Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such blow up the baloons spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden? and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..  Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture got a mix that was just as strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)  Sorry for any spelling errors I missed school today.. (grin)..  Why musta  space station be so difficult?? why must we have girders? why be confined to earth based ideas lets think new ideas after all space is not earth

'ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE IS GRAVITY!!!    This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary  ether sucking structures AND why we observe orbital motion!!    Ether the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth\'s surface not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin the lattices both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it  converting it distilling localized mass time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = dark matter)    The earth isn\'t exactly spinning around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary and the sun\'s image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a  faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but  its foot print being a line not a point. [sunrise sunset])      The moon isn\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\'s ether field which is  itself in the sun\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth\'s axis like a top slowing down. The orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars\' images being dragged around by the sun\'s ether feild.    The earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly because  the path is not the same. The moon\'s lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there.     With a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as earth\'s shadow upon it and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge  would you guess that they are about the same size just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /                      M    |      |      OR                M               _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating turntable view  of the moon only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\'ve seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun during the  day. Try and draw that earth shadow.) Its only the moon\'s image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is the light part is  the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun even when it appears to be behind us.    Light-Years between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The piece of light may have experienced  many years but the trip could be very quick our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this I recommend studying history. I\'d  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I\'d start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I\'d totally isolate myself record me thinking DOG  backwards and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media the ether and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow (of time which  I\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something and seeing what I  could get with my machine\'s receiver next to it.      If you don\'t think you\'ll live to see it consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life\'s data could be written on the wind (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS we could be jamming our reception or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\'m curios to see what  they did and ate. Don\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don\'t need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept \'immortal\' come from? Wheat is a weed it  is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel  future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods (he had to teach them what that meant) by  advising them in their past. Basically he manipulated them into  reproducing and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history rewriting it  in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd but we couldn\'t remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally when he could prune no  more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped  through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes and lost my body  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E. you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal there\'s more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here the one who looks like us sells rides he can make you a  Prince or a Queen or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though if he likes  your work but thinks you\'re getting wise he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self and you\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he\'s here its just that that is work and with  every \'adjustment\' this becomes less the world he cultivated which  loosens his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country  our money and they\'re spending it on us RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8 IRS collects 10 gives 5 to  congress and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making what a 30\% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10\% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world sure but  mostly bury it. WHY? Food production is 2\% GNP? construction 6\% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality I shouted to the twelve its chaos! They  said no its order. He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and \'vanishing\' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver if it is on the ground and  pointed up you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children but very very tough to kill. Also They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren\'t eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat I get a  huge belly lose muscle mass sleep A LOT and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit I get more energy a Hollywood-flat belly and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over.

'    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However given the number of bright ones there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10\% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories placing GRBs throughout the Universe require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a \'disk\' population) or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical \'halo\' population).  We don\'t see this so if they are Galactic they must be in a halo at least 250000 light years in radius and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison the Earth is 25000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren\'t concentrated in the known spacelanes and we don\'t see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources renewable energy and the environment.  The training course organised for the benefit of francophone African experts will be hosted by ESRIN the European Space Agency\'s establishment in Frascati which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA\'s remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing selected from 19 francophone countries from northern western and central Africa and three regional African centres will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources renewable energy and the environment with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting oceanography and near- coastal areas agriculture forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA.

'In the April edition of One Small Step for a Space Activist Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:   Another problem is what are called \'wraps\' (or sometimes    the \'center tax\'). When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom fully $10    billion won\'t be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\'t) but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term \'center tax\'. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.  My dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago when I first read this in your posting I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\'t post a response immediately I do have a real job I\'m supposed to be doing here at Headquarters & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also I spent last weekend in Kansas City at the National Science Teachers  Association conference extolling the virtues of SSF to 15000 science teachers.]  First off yes the concept of \'center tax\' or \'wrap\' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly the total \'tax\' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1 WP-2 and WP-4 center \'taxes\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8\%  Over the life of the SSF program using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF a tax at a 1.8\% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion but I will concede it\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you don\'t if you get it take-out). For example at WP-4 the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don\'t have the numbers in front of me but I\'d guess at least 95\% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3 but it\'s only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question What is the government doing with SSF funds that don\'t go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds which aren\'t eaten up by the center tax?)  At WP-4 we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back) with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF) DC switchgear DC-DC converter units and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18552 to 23405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5840 cycles per year).  As a final example my \'home\' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally the money raised by the \'tax\' does not all go into a \'slush fund.\' At Lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax however goes to fund the \'general\' services at the Center like the library the  central computer services division the Contractor  who removes the snow etc. Thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn\'t go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example) and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is \'billable\' to SSF would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library

' The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate  onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh  envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You\'ve hit on the real kicker however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don\'t know what the proton uses  for fuel but since they are derived from ICBM\'s I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don\'t have the ullage problem that cryo\'s  do.

If you go solar you have to replace the arrays every trip with current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty.  Refueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and] turn out to be a pain.  You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or    ( and refueling) .  You still can\'t do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!

' As I heard the story before Albert came up the the theory o\'relativity and warped space nobody could account for Mercury\'s orbit.  It ran a little fast (I think) for simple Newtonian physics.  With the success in finding Neptune to explain the odd movments of Uranus
' The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\'s observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\'s system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas \'twere not so.  Mercury\'s perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity and one of it\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\'s numbers rather than Leverrier\'s.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein and that\'s fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   Forgive him he is a barbarian

' Actually the reboost will probably be done last so that there is a fuel reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that).  But yes you\'ve got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it\'s not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware since it has to include attitude control (HST\'s own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance) guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST\'s own gyros to an external device) and separation (you don\'t want it left attached afterward if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short

'      Well I guess I\'m left wondering just who all the \'light fascists\' think *they* are.  Yes I understand the issues.  I don\'t even particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.  A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:  \t1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area not a lot of mass and be in a fairly low orbit.  \t2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?  \t3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of \'seeing\' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.  \t4) If your answer to 3) above was the astronomers then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words put up or shut up.   Probably so.  I\'m just not sure we agree about who the \'stupid\' are.

'I\'m not very impressed by the old so-called prospecting work from LPI it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there.   [...]  Translation:  It doesn\'t support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future to Which You MUST Subscribe...  Fred we\'re all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some degree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so.  You really don\'t get what the \'complaints\' are about do you?   [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between    feelings regarding Nick\'s method and judgments about his meaning]  T  F  *** Fred\'s issue #1;  Nick\'s alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of \'allegorically\'.  That was my point all along Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don\'t you take a poll Fred if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And as usual you defend your insults with he started it.  Yeah I took some of his research and called it my own but he started it.  So what if I stole his car he stole my lawnmower first.  Besides that I think it\'s still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  I never borrowed it I already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me.  Make up yer mind Fred!      First I try to address what I think you meant for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark.  Then I point out that I am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and I\'m stupid for it.  I just can\'t win can I Fred?  You\'ve got a great point here somewhere it\'s just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick\'s alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of Nick\'s or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that people aren\'t required in all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program I read as People are required in all parts of all space processes.  So help me out here Fred since I\'m so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter I sure hope it\'s one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I\'d only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But alas that\'s your job Fred.  And finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory/insult.  Sadly one point addressed a \'plan\' that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No no I finally got it.  You don\'t like the plan that Nick\'s posts made you imagine.  And you don\'t like Nick\'s obnoxious behavior even though it\'s no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first you\'d remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior.  It\'s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that\'s no worse than your own.  Let\'s see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn\'t and my complaints about your name-calling are immature while your name-calling isn\'t.  Yeah right.  Maybe if you called me some more names I might see it better Fred.  Net.ghod wannabe?  Naturally Fred you\'ve correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try proves).  I didn\'t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because I thought you were such a jerk that you\'d bring it back to the Net playing right into my hands. Alas I had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass still isn\'t clear.  Well Fred you exposed me.  Now I\'ll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA since they all know that I\'m stupider than Fred McCall.  Well I just hope you\'re happy.  Please leave me alone now.  I just don\'t have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.

Mitchell                           March 23 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of a lunar colony tele-operating machines for work and play disseminating educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project people of all ages interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures interfacing and electronics software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth. The floor is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in space.

'yeah
' No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those discussions a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually that sounds unlikely.  I don\'t know what the launch vehicle would be but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for e.g.  launch support would probably  cover NASA\'s incremental costs pretty well.   No as noted LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design per  Clementine and related programs.  I\'m sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure but after all  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea mostly because I\'ve got a background in astronomy it\'s hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which unfortunately this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know it\'s a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers. Commercial projects however

'Press Release No.19-93 Paris 22 April 1993  Users of ESA\'s Olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments  Today Europe\'s space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does had OLYMPUS not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s. This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission videoconferencing business television        distance teaching and rural telephony to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe over several months        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market

'Oddly enough  The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years the golden age of flight.  I would call it the granite years reflecting the primitive nature of it.  It was  romantic swashbuckling daredevils  those daring young men in their flying machines.  But in reality it sucked.  Death was a highly likely occurence  and  the environment blew.  Ever see the early navy pressure suits  they were modified  diving suits.  You were ready to star in plan 9 from outer space.   Radios  and Nav AIds were a joke  and engines ran on castor oil.  They  picked and called aviators men with iron stomachs  and it wasn\'t due to vertigo.  Oddly enough now we are in the golden age of flight.  I can hop the shuttle to NY for $90 bucks  now that\'s golden.  Mercury gemini and apollo were romantic  but let\'s be honest. Peeing in bags  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime you needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug. Romantic  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely new golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls and used space ship lots.  hhhmmmmm  maybe i\'ll  retract that golden age bit.   Maybe it was better in the old days.  Of course then we\'ll have  wally schirra telling his great grand children In my day
'    He also ignores a few other things.  While organics would become significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus some things would no longer be economically feasible) oil is hardly an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  As supply decreases prices rise and alternatives become more competetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been an estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is we always seem to have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.  [I\'m not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as hard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true during hte \'oil crisis\' days of the 70\'s.]  --  Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live  in the real world.   -- Mary Shafer

'...  Funny.  A bit disturbing.  Forging a posting seems somewhat unethical
' You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.   Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?   As you have posted on this subject Allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.  I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened
'To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..    From the March 1993 Aero Vision (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      On Monday March 15 at noon Quest Aerospace Education Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz director and   SSTO program manager and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11 and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the   McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude   of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational   settings to teach mathematics and science as well as social   studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available   either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit which includes everything   needed for three launches or as individual rockets for $12 each.   Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-   7302.    By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is it an advertisement to buy the product.  I make no claims about the product.  This is posted for public information only (hey I found it amusing...)

'There has been something bothering me while watching NASA Select for a while.  Well I should\'nt say bothering maybe wondering would be better.  When they are going to launch they say (sorry but I forget exactly who is saying what OTC to PLT I think) Clear caution & warning memory.  Verify no unexpected errors. ....  I am wondering what an expected error might be.  Sorry if this is a really dumb question

'   I hate to pour cold water on this but currently seawater extracted uranium even using the new improved fiber absorbers from Japan is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now around $10/lb.  Right now there are mines closing because they can\'t compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  Demand and supply balance will collapse is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting but it\'s a long term project
' I think this is a little inaccurate based on Feynman\'s account of the software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners but hadn\'t had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters
'Archive-name: space/controversy Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:06 $  CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS      These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being     offered. The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which     much of the net community has settled. Please DON\'T bring them up again     unless there\'s something truly new to be discussed. The net can\'t set     public policy that\'s what your representatives are for.       WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like     guidance system components) and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     scooped by people uninvolved in the mission. However NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities) the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970 the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source which     was jettisoned fell intact into the 20000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].      To make your own informed judgement some references you may wish to     pursue are:      A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel     Salisbury in Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG     Controversy *Planetary Report* May-June 1987 pages 3-7.

April 1980.)       IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle\'s Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS) Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center) and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300000000 kilograms/year \t  Natural sources:     75000000 kilograms/year \t  Shuttle sources:\t  725000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25\% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065\%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1\% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don\'t* try to hold your breath exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn possibly the bends certainly some     [mild reversible painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes     you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.

The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the Kerwin     team\'s medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered and after the Kerwin team     examined them they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of     that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE FACE ON MARS      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance and the one more often     published with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry don\'t     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

'What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin Mariatta Boeing Mcdonell Douglas General Dynamics Lockheed Rockwell) getting together and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles and spending say $3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say has the shuttle  ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea figure out how many how often where to etc...)  Then taking this data and forming a sematech type company (bad example I know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs.  Then to take all of those designs and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are and demonstrate those technologies in order to  eliminate designs that can\'t be built today.  And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.  And from here all of these companies went their separate ways with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street and saying I want to build this vehicle and here are the numbers that show \%20 ROI fund me...)   Now many of you think that this is a joke but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP NLS ALS DCY? etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese and european spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress
'  As an Amateur Radio operator (VHF 2metres) I like to keep up with what is  going up (and for that matter what is coming down too).   In about 30 days I have learned ALOT about satellites current future and  past all the way back to Vanguard series and up to Astro D observatory  (space).  I borrowed a book from the library called Weater Satellites (I  think it has a photo of the earth with a TIROS type satellite on it.)   I would like to build a model or have a large color poster of one of the  TIROS satellites I think there are places in the USA that sell them. ITOS is my favorite looking satellite
'   >Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks    >for sounding rockets?     Well first you work out how much cold gas you need then make the    tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload with telemetry guidance etc. etc. and a telescope cluster weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10\% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas  quantity.  If you really need to know send me email and I\'ll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.  Cheers
'The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I Hugh Kelso and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray Washington State.  I started asking for an hour and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is we were called back by an aide who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But with Murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal communicators tellecommunications new services etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor or majellan) and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didn\'t know the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this would be something that she would be very interested in although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled

'    Nick Haines sez;    >(given that I\'ve heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in    >maturity I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).     Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I\'ve never    heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process\' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed written tested delivered supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process\' by Watts S. Humphrey Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be how long it will    take to produce how expensive it will be or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls rigorous project    management; having done something once can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood implementation is    consistent. This includes things like software inspection a    rigorous software testing framework more configuration management    and typically a `software engineering process group\' within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5. Defects are prevented the process is automated
'Archive-name: space/acronyms Edition: 8  Acronym List for sci.astro sci.space and sci.space.shuttle: Edition 8 1992 Dec 7 Last posted: 1992 Aug 27  This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym please let me know!  Also if there\'s an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you drop me a line and if I can figure it out I\'ll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw I\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\'re on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they\'re introduced are omitted. Further some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless they\'re simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who\'s sent suggestions since the first version of the list and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu) who is maintaining an independent list somewhat more verbose in character than mine and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de) who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms mostly in German (which I read fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary Acronyms and Abbreviations_ a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.  Thanks Larry!

April 6 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons Director Office of Science and Technology Policy outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3 three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development operations utilization Shuttle integration facilities research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans Japanese and Canadians -- have decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.

'I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design powerplant design control systems and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev Su Iluchine Migoyan etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23 Su 27 Yak 38 the cockpit of an F-111(!) among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience expecially given the fact that the museum was until a year or so ago closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute or the program I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute and most of it\'s faculty have e-mail addresses.

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.

This helps get away from the small-town everybody knows everything syndrome which some people like but I don\'t.  Call it several thousand people.  For physical dimensions a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough to contain surprises at least until you spent considerable time getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb big enough for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that 5km which means a 10km circumference if we\'re talking a sphere.

'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\'s LA Times (Thursday April 15 1993 p. D1).  I thought I\'d post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the Space Age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading for example What\'s New - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\'s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere) and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent I think the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely our mind children - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway let me quote some of this article but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer consultant and research associate at MIT)  At 35 America\'s Space Age won\'t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\'s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed with few notable exceptions such as Voyager the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......

'  Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US Government?  Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars who will stop you? The UN can\'t other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?  If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation who will stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you?   Why can\'t a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church  stating which was Portugals and what was Spains and along came the Reformation and made it all null and void..   What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged and offer your services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble.. Basically find a country who wants to go into space but can\'t for soem reason or another but who will give you a home.. Such as Saudia Arabia or whatever.. There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN got to them and offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy but. is it.. Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it. The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else they will not care..  If your worried about the US do the same thing..  Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what ever..

'From: Gene Wright <gene@theporch.raider.net>    I\'ll say!  Imagine that there were a couple groups up there maybe landing a few weeks apart.  The year-mark starts coming on for the first group. Isn\'t a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential winner?  Yeah that\'s a shame that Team A\'s life support gave out so close to the deadline.  Thanks for the billion.  On the other hand if Apollo cost ~25billion for a few days or weeks in space in 1970 dollars then won\'t the reward have to be a lot more than only 1 billion to get any takers?  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases

'NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I\'ve typed it in verbatim for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons Director Office of Science and Technology Policy outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3 three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development operations utilization Shuttle integration facilities research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\'s new technology investment. As a result station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans Japanese and Canadians -- have decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.

'From another space forum     When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56  solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers  lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250000 foot  altitude then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media      It\'s been a long time since something like this happened.  We\'ve  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately the worker\'s supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its extra payload.  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.      A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that  the Shuttle processor will take appropriate action.  Thiokol is a  subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.  _________________________________________________________  Karl Anderson\t DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version Control  Dept 53K/006-2\t\tRochester

'I\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn\'t entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg four of these from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It\'s not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don\'t think I\'ll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example everybody can sell you everything.   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually he worked out a deal and on Dec 4 1992 he met with Koptev who heads the  Russian space program to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can\'t figure out how to spell the town I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50\% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications they\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using costs run about $378000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier.  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20 which is a huge retirement fund organization Cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don\'t worry  because we\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won\'t worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting 25\% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in  rubles.  To get around this RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older

Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will but Jobs\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times he has claimed to have hardware which will blow anything else away while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations including a young man who will identify himself only as Bill and claims to be the MS-iah.  Former members of the cult some only recently deprogrammed speak hesitantly of their former lives including being forced to work 20-hour days and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.

'    SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software Engineering Institute).  I\'m not sure but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software.

Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process; the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.

If I read you right you\'re saying in essence that with a larger    economy nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than    just a we have the money why not? approach.  Ah but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It\'s not like they\'d be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It\'s a way of funding high-tech research just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research under the pretense that it\'s good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact I\'m pretty sure you do) but it does count as investment spending
'  So how much would it cost as a private venture
' When the Lunar Society\'s $500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was mentioned at Making Orbit somebody asked Jerry Pournelle have you talked to Bill Gates?.  The answer:  Yes.  He says that if he were going to sink that much money into it
' I hold that space cannot be curved for the simple reason that it can have no properties. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I for one
'Archive-name: space/data Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $  ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES DATA ETC.   INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images data catalogs information releases and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing \'anonymous FTP\'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don\'t even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large and I won\'t attempt to cover common formats (GIF etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X     use XV 2.11 available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58) in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list NASA press     releases shuttle launch advisories and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body) use commands like:  \tsend SPACE Index \tsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter Saturn and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item VIEWING IMAGES below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. It\'s in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio infrared optical UV and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors     keywords title words or abstract text words.

'I\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project he has spent time with  them recently using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\'t think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren\'t - I fell asleep during that part) I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                   ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go this is actually fairly            /  | /        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate as        /                |          the graph wasn\'t up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G the booster engines are  throtled back.  However they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can\'t tell us.  Read Aviation Leak.  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\'s reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers
' Thanks for typing that in Steven.  Sounds like a fall back and regroup strategy session.  I wanted to add that my copy of the brochure arrived with a flattering cover letter:  Invitations are being extended to those who have demonstrated a strong committment to space program development and have been influential in its advancement.  We sincerely hope you will be able to attend.  Wow! I wonder which of my contributions to the conquest of space convinced them to send me this letter?  I hope you decide to go
'   American perhaps but nothing military about it.  I learned (mostly) slugs when we talked English units in high school physics and while the teacher was an ex-Navy fighter jock the book certainly wasn\'t produced by the military.

'What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?  Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     my own pet theory is that it\'s  Flying saucers  entering hyperspace :-)  but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes
'   The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled- and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the \'30\'s but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn\'t require gov\'t to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice some were gov\'t funded some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.   I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base I can\'t give them.  We just don\'t know enough.  The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be when they will practical how much will have to be invested to start them

On April 9 real-time commands were sent as planned to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9 the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12 1993 to June 14 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15 a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12 cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) Dust Detector (DDS) and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12 an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14 a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15 cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15 a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15 1993 is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS            EUV UVS EPD MAG HIC and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13 1993 using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday April 15 1993 the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  \tDistance from Earth         152606000 km (1.02 AU) \tDistance from Sun           277519800 km (1.86 AU) \tHeliocentric Speed          93400 km per hour \tDistance from Jupiter       543973900 km \tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes

'Archive-name: space/new_probes Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $  UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES      Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below     would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets Cassini Mission Design     team ISAS/NASDA launch schedules press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope X-ray CCD cameras and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s     satellites and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712) the     first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of     Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695) who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn\'s rings.  \t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory) \t ------------------------------------------------------------- \t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch \t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist \t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist \t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist \t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist \t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival \t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release \t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry \t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission \t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)       GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe in transit.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990 it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane it went to Jupiter instead and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU and surprisingly its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right a solar-studies spacecraft     that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results see     *Science* V. 257 p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

'LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics                 Orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists            CLAIM to be looking for a Unified Field Theory in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe which he            calls the Reciprocal System is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component MOTION existing in THREE dimensions in DISCRETE            UNITS and in two RECIPROCAL forms SPACE and TIME.                      (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                      From these two postulates Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe using various combinations of            translational vibrational rotational and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL            DATUM).                        At each step in the development Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe (photons sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS] charges atoms molecules globular star            clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white            dwarf stars pulsars quasars ETC.) even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of            matter.

They have other related publications including the quarterly            journal RECIPROCITY.                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\'s lack of a fancy PH.D. degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE IN-CONSISTENCIES ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a unified field theory that works but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that epicycles crystal spheres            geocentricity flat earth theory etc. ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\'s Theory and was (or            still is) President of Larson\'s organization THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of            their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY.  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   Super Collider BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super            Collider in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific            value.                      Most physicists don\'t realize it but according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson as described in his books the strange GOOFY            particles (mesons hyperons ALLEGED quarks etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab            Cern etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the Supercollider?!                                 Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as            proposed is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light            which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum.                       In Larson\'s Theory a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\'s Theory the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME and ONLY ONE dimension            of space and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus Earth Jupiter            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove Einstein\'s General Theory of Relativity.                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than General Relativity can by            INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity.  In one or more of his            books he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of Special            Relativity including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds they become significant and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing            about this.]                            In regard to mass increases it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\'s Theory            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe for example is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called Big Bang (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION by Dewey B. Larson 1984 North Pacific            Publishers (P.O. Box 13255 Portland Oregon  97213) 456            pages indexed hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author an UNrecognized GENIUS more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries including the FORMATION of galaxies binary and            multiple star systems and solar systems the TRUE ORIGIN of            the 3-degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma-           ray bursts and the TRUE NATURE of quasars pulsars white            dwarfs exploding galaxies etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\'s success:            In his first book in 1959 THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION published in 1984 the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe which Larson calls            the Cosmic Sector.  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe and            the way they are connected together the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION            and in some of his other books.                      First of all according to Larson stars do NOT generate            energy by fusion.  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is the lower is this limit.  A star\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space making a single lone star            again are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system orbiting each other.                       According to Larson a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE) because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter neutron            stars black holes etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL then instead of a single            white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION Larson used all            this information and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe to derive            his own version of Bode\'s Law.                         Black Hole FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black            holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole and            concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original black holes.                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black            holes etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION it is            clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR NOT the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory.                           By the way I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser.  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\'s            Theory books and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago in connection            with UFO\'s and unorthodox inventors but I never was able to            find out how or why they work or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson which describes part of            Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      As indicated in the preceding chapter the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons we find are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\'s book NOTHING BUT            MOTION] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities and that            although the motions that constitute these electrons are in            many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space because they are inherently rotating units of space            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron            like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.                            Note that in Larson\'s Theory UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the unit frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the unit rate).             (Unit velocity is the speed of light and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light            according to Larson\'s Theory.)  [I might have the above and            below labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons or other particles in space perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\'s Theory an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the unit frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)

SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS published in 1959 in            his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            science (or physics or astronomy etc.) as well as            the scientific literature and the education systems to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC UW-Madison Cambridge Cornell University and            elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

' \tI am puzzled by the term concept. Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth\'s gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies

'   The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer I believe the probe starts a \'search for Earth\' sequence (involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent just so the probe knows that we haven\'t forgotten about it.

'Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First in February the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this Banner reflector was blank NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial as filmed from the Mir.    The second development has been that Space Marketing Inc the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft is now pushing the Environmental Billboard.  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory the Environmental Billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area deployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.    To help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s delicate protective ozone layer according to Mike Lawson head of SMI. Furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s atmosphere. According to IMI as the biodegradable material burns it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer. The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re-enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply.    This would not be a cheap advertisement costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost $600000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta Georgia it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian\'s questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit plus $10-15 M for a launch) then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon someone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the legal challenges would win out (and yes I am an amateur astronomer and no I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light pollution but I know of no prohibition of it...)  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low enough orbit and it relies upon reflected light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy since that\'s the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for only a $500000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding for this but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro

'Okay lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.   The project manager is Dr. John Hunter and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What you may ask does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing really but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing where I work but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station)  The gun uses a methane-air mixture which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around 50000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning but I haven\'t had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s) since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.

'    As for advertising -- sure why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we\'d need    to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization    on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isn\'t all that much is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot it\'s only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You\'d be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or rather a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark) and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour though.  Buy a cheap launch system design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft build 50 said craft establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you\'d be better off with a sulphur compound I suppose) and some sort of propellant and Bob\'s your uncle.  I\'ll do it for say 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.  Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors? Who else might be interested?  Would they buy it given that it\'s a _lot_ more expensive and not much more impressive than putting a large set of several-km inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO
'The following press release was distributed April 1 by NASA Headquarters.  Space Station Redesign Advisory Members Named  Along with Dr. Charles M. Vest recently named by Vice President Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the Space Station NASA has announced the names of representatives from government and industry and academic experts from across the country to participate in an independent review of the redesign options being developed by NASA.  I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. America\'s future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care said Vest. We have assembled a diverse panel of experts that I believe will bring the appropriate measures of insight integrity and objectivity to this critical task.  The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA\'s redesign team and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space station international partners also are being asked to  participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory committee will submit its recommendations in June.

'Re: Space billboards  Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon once upon a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered a Goodyear Blimp in orbit.  The idea was to use a large structure that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has. Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination it could eventually be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing it.  It had quite feasible economics which I will not post here because I don\'t want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such a thing
'     I don\'t have to try reading a bit Pat.  I *work* as a government contractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes they sign some (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week\'s funding) multi-year contracts; they also aren\'t willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it (which can happen arbitrarily at any time no matter what previous plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant.  I\'d like a source for that statement about the reason they aren\'t cutting defense spending as much as they would like; I just don\'t buy it. The other thing I find a bit \'funny\' about your posting Pat is that several other people answered the question pretty much the same way I did; mine is the one you comment (and incorrectly I think) on.

'Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a safe mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully) it could be turned on again.    For that matter why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments turned off rather than just safed.  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....    I\'ve heard the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft causes radio noise.  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed safe mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation and once a (week month year whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time if funding has been restored the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it great if not so it\'s lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit exiting the solar system etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini Pluto Flyby

What about the Coke/Pepsi thing  a few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other  people into the space funding business for some time. Frankly I\'ve  thought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight only the  innovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding.  If a PI can show co-funding for any proposal that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no  co-funding. Once again

'  Dennis I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA) for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities for-profits non-profits and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now I\'m sure your a competent engineer Dennis but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don\'t understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn\'t a flame jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration Dennis isn\'t overhead.   Dennis Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$ the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem.

'I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me. But here is how i understand it.  At Speed  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe. It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.   AS the wing thickens  the more the pipes bend.  If they have no place to go  they begin to stall  and force compression stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into  then drag is reduced.     Essentially  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are subtract

'       TRIAD the first drag-free satellite was designed and built by the  Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space in 1961).

The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here\'s my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible

'prb@access.digex.com (Pat) Pontificated:  What I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual ASC G&C 2102  \tDuring the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is \tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower \tclearance is achieved. Then the tilt maneuver (roll program) \torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a \tnegative q-alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other \tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort \tmaneuver complexity improved S-band look angles and crew view of \tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining \tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target \tin second stage.      This really is a good answer but it\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\'ll try     to interpret.      1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)\tThen we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack \tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the \trelative wind) and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line \tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly \tnegative angle (a negative q-alpha).\tThis causes a little bit of \tdownward force (toward the belly of the Orbiter or the +Z \tdirection) and this force alleviates structural loading. \tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\'re about the \tmost delicate part of the vehicle.      3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more \tmass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or \tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be \tthe case if we didn\'t roll (performance gain).      4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated \tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort \tmaneuvers the Return To Launch Site (decreased abort maneuver \tcomplexity).      5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio \tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio \tantennae on the Orbiter (improved S-band look angles).      6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a \thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is \tmore nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east \t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity \tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: \tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. \tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its \tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question Why isn\'t the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the top     [Orbiter side] and the bottom [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\'s.  (A side note: the     Saturn V\'s also had a roll program.  Don\'t ask me why -- I\'m a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the roll     maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.

F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions) SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can\'t get a satellite feed some cable operators carry SELECT.     It\'s worth asking if yours doesn\'t.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences briefings by NASA officials and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

'   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..    Why not??  Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where it is which means you either nail it to something that doesn\'t move or you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a deactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on board.   Apart from which
'Let\'s see. These aren\'t in a strict sense amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR or high power rockets to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A D engine for example can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An F engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far engines up to size O are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives and are not as controlled. Class F engines BTW are not HPR engines but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society The Tripoli Rocket Society I believe which holds events at various sites throughout the year with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It\'s legit. I suggest you send for a catalog - but forget the dynamite
'  I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky.  Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV they have commercials to pay for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don\'t like it you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky and there is a floating billboard out there you can\'t turn it off.  It\'s the same  reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.

If you really are annoyed   get some legislation to create a dark sky zone  where in all light emissions are protected in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors like air conditioners and Vacuums. In practice they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.  I say: What I\'m objecting to here is a floating billboard that presumably would move around in the sky.  I for one am against legislating at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy and would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and aesthetic values that make us human.

'  The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit \'fuzzy regions\'.  These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that \'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel we\'ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible. The originator of the technique said that NASA wasn\'t interested but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldn\'t hold a lot of fuel for deceleration.  \tThis from an issue of \'Science News\' or \'The Planetary Report\' I believe

In short they were quite mainstream and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.  I suggest you read The Bishop\'s Boys or the biography by Harry Gates? Combs?

'I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the event and the 1/r^2 law.  So if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation) could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays  being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.  Just some idle babbling

'        Well lets see....I took a class on this last fall and I have no notes so I\'ll try to wing it...           Here\'s how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova or supernova.  In this time they don\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\'s) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system (Pioneer Venus has one either Pion. 10 or 11 GINGA and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction) and they show signs of homogeneity i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now I suppose you are saying Well we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.  Well not necessarily.  Remember we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11) so we should be able with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\'s an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo and corona models don\'t work also.  As I said before looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts (short timescales high energy) black holes and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case as I said before these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model where the bursts are confined to the disk but you sample out to large distances say 750 mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before

'  Well if you\'re going to get upset with this you might as well direct some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA. (Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)   This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone know if he\'s involved?   This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to build large inflatable space structures.   If this is true I think it\'s a great idea.  Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development and given that Freedom appears to be shrinking towards the vanishing point I question whether NASA\'s space station is going to provide much if any knowledge in this area. (Especially if a design such as Faget\'s wingless orbiter is chosen...) If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so much the better.

' I don\'t care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at  Marquette University of Wisconsin Madison Utah State Weber State or Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead to be a legitimate charge.   I did they never heard of it but suggest that like our president did that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.   No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on. Kinda funny isn\'t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead.   Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being  selective with the facts again.   If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your friend at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap were gone. This merely points out a  blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.  Dennis
' One consideration to remember is that if you don\'t turn it off now you may not be able to later.  This isn\'t a case of reaching over and flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly to execute a turn off command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle spacecraft
'   In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of I think their cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else a working SSTO is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G range.   True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I don\'t think it would be enough to attract the investors given the risks involved.  If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures 100\% of the available launch market

' Actually Hiten wasn\'t originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all so it indeed didn\'t have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn\'t be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel

We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles nuclear energy computers flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - you\'ve lost it!  The me generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle - to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened to your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little and Max you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more before putting the first rubber on the road.  Max Hunter - you didn\'t take ten years to build Thor and by God we\'re not going to take ten years to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!       To be sure

'Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible. O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research is a real question for me. O\'Connor said everything is fair game including dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country working closely with the Russian space station Mir and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.  O\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O\'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer the Post writer got confused here. I listened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press on Monday and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options sorted by cost [low medium and high]. In another part of the briefing he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC and Single Launch Core [wingless Orbiter] @ JSC. Later in response to a reporters question I thought I heard O\'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a moderate cost option in between low & high cost options. Not the high cost option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage for example

April 23 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS  \tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two if needed.  \tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities or EVAs was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training maneuver times required using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.  \tBasically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics or unknowns of spacewalks Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.  \tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks officials have determined that changing out the gyros solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.  \tWhen we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks highest through lowest priority and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros solar arrays WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk five EVAs were deemed appropriate said Milt Heflin Lead Flight Director for the mission.  \tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two three or four EVAs.  \tWe have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs Heflin said.  In planning for all Space Shuttle missions it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.  \tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center called joint integrated simulations lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition many stand alone underwater training runs will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.  \tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.  \tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center Houston and the Marshall Space Flight Center Huntsville Ala.  \tAlso the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps the flight controllers and trainers.  \tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew

'  Thanks for the information!  I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e) i.e. about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter\'s -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter\'s influence.   Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71000 km = 44000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.

'Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you\'d detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a pusher plate attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium krypton helium neutrons evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can\'t see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate)

' (excerpts from posting on this topic)    (I\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\'re not only in twilight.) :o)    Now my comments:   I\'d like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend getting away from it all (paved roads indoor plumbing  malls ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night - wow!)  I don\'t watch  commercial television but I can imagine just how disgusting beer  truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven) at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid

On April 19 cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) Dust Detector (DDS) and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19 a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19 a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21 the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).

'SSF is up for redesign again.  Let\'s do it right this time!  Let\'s step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach explified by Shuttle and SSF so far was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits etc.  Secondly the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF\'s 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir Shuttle/Mir linkup and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity but also in lunar and Martian gravities and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term low-priority project since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon Earth-Mars Earth-asteroid etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs inject fuel etc.  Once the fleet is working it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF\'s pricetag we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study life\'s adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if needed in special-purpose orbits.  N.B. we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well
'    Well pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to go the \'right\' way on the energy curve).  Now where *did* I put those sackcloth and ashes?  [I was not and am not \'pretending\' anything; I am *so* pleased you are not surprised though.]   Note that I didn\'t say it was perpetual motion or even that it sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was sounds almost like perpetual motion which I at least consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?   I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different \'run\' for each actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs technological risks etc. are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure it\'s possible and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable approach?   And I still wonder at what sort of \'burning\' rate you could get with something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery.

'I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317 or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design which he calls Geode (rough on the outside but a gem on the inside) or the ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.  As you can see from file geodeA.gif it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design docking forces are limited to 400 pounds which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight with little additional launch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here) but we\'ve never had a reason to do it while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties control debris generation and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen or b) stays where it is and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember it supports the whole stack during launch) and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge which has the same volume as a hab module could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical data and communication systems getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City and he reports that he was warmly received.  However the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.    Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll let you all know when I get that done.  -- Ken Jenks NASA/JSC/GM2
'I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in first and second grade (69-70 70-71).  They came in Chocolate strawberry and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well it seemed like space foil at the time).    The taste is hard to describe although I remember it fondly.  It was most certainly more candy than say a modern Power Bar.  Sort of a toffee injected with vitamins.  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough approximation of the taste.  Strawberry sucked.  Man

'Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration.  Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine versus the adjusted income also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done paying for materials workers and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..   Basically to get back to my beginning statement

'Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don\'t want to see the FAQ add \'Frequently Asked Questions\' to your KILL file for this group (if you\'re not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject you\'re out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources use them too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren\'t surprised but 9999 out of 10000 have usually been     thought of before. Again contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you\'re on Usenet.     Minimize cross references [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit Subject: lines especially if you\'re taking a tangent.     Send mail instead avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth \t100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST \tnot SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all \treferences.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\'re \tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail \tor article) state your institution etc. Don\'t assume the \t\'reply\' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\'t post what everyone \twill get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: \tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals \t(use carriage returns).

' Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to    invest in newer launch systems. I don\'t think a big cost advantage for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years).  Lockheed would be the place to ask since you would probably have to buy  the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia).  They should know a lot about the possibilities I haven\'t heard them propose US launches so I assume they looked into it and found it  unprofitable.    Yes...   Comparable to the Zenit I suppose but since it looks like nothing will be built there you might just as well pick any spot.  The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and Kazakstan are still cooperating. Later

' Actually there are people who will tell you that it *would* be enough to do SSTO development if done privately as a cut-rate operation.  Of course they may be over-optimistic.  You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications that would help pay for its development costs.  I\'d be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger

' The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt to market it.  They\'re basically happy with their government business and don\'t want to have to learn how to sell commercially.  A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They\'d need to go after multi-satellite launches a la Ariane and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly.  They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly.  If memory serves the pad used for the Mars Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so.  There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So was that stranded Intelsat

'From the article What\'s New Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:  ........ WHAT\'S NEW (in my opinion) Friday 16 April 1993  Washington DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950 science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published The Man Who Sold the Moon which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold\'s latest movie. Now Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism but Mike Lawson CEO of Space Marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really

' I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the  operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded.  I don\'t remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case he was  asked about that very matter: Why can\'t we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going?  His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE Magellan Hubble etc is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just as he had benefited from his predicessor\'s funding choices he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions

'    That would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on Ulysses and PVO and Ginga et al. would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact be- fore BATSE having this widely separated Interplanetary Network was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector one cannot locate a burst (except to say It\'s somewhere in the field of view.).  With two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because say the Earth blocked that part of the  sky) voila you have an error box.  BATSE by having 8 detectors of its own can do its own location determination but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC like David like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didn\'t mean to though.  Some believe (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be a mean nasty God though
' In fact you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems beyond what you face in low orbit is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches but you don\'t have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches

'COMMERCIAL SPACE NEWS/SPACE TECHNOLOGY INVESTOR NUMBER 22     This is number twenty-two in an irregular series on commercial  space activities.  The commentaries included are my thoughts on  these developments.       Sigh... as usual I\'ve gotten behind in getting this column  written.  I can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in  the space biz.  This column is put together at lunch hour and after  the house quiets down at night so data can quickly build up if  there\'s a lot of other stuff going on.  I\'ve complied a lot of  information and happenings since the last column so I\'m going to  have to work to keep this one down to a readable length.  Have fun!

As published in US Industrial Outlook 1993  (which was released in January) revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates this year\'s projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M future sales will be adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1900 M primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15\%).

In general not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  Space Business Indicators in mid-year and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5000 M if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers and the year should show about a 10\% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year\'s data future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 \% per year  through the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation and in mid April McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation such as a  planned on-orbit spares may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request launch on demand  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches worth about $2200 M to MDC and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S. nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/Spacelifter program.  At this  time while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all ELV upgrade programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed Spacelifter  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget  deliberations particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC GO-AHEAD    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a Star Wars spinoff using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists  agricultural planners and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act as passed last  November provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large  government-sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology and I believe can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95\%-plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash- generating unit.  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate  management Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses  many market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993 which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors in my opinion this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD\'s case to get the division back on track the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW Rockwell Lockheed and Martin and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC) have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC) are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed)  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace the operator of the Ariane launch system is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early  February Arianespace released their annual market survey which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995 Ariane  holds contracts for 31 General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7 and Great Wall\'s Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25\% split between weather Earth observation and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 \% over today\'s average level to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years but in the second half of the  decade Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys there aren\'t outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points and while there are improved network solutions  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year Atlas is capable of 6-12 Long March 4-8  Japan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4 Russia\'s Proton capable of 8 and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launchand a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately the Pegasus functioned as expected and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA OSC and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB their  investigation will take about 6 months and is primarily looking at  lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space  Transportation who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column some of the initial  investigations have been concluded and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the Aerokosmos  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus and the Severkosmos  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  \'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs but I can\'t identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera Poker Flat Cape York White Sands Alabama Off-Shore  Platform Hawaii and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace Aerospatiale Deutsche  Aerospace and Italian organizations but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below) I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s.     What is known is in Feb 1992 the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983 expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M 181 Kg SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro a small launch firm in Herndon Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS) a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as the main  alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro\'s literature the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles with a first launch planned for 1995 and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering  launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M) but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press China Development Corp. (CDC)  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10\% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10\% of the  satellite\'s communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites starting with ROCSAT-1 a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is Asiasat- 2 but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based Asiasat program involving Chinese Hong Kong and  other Asian investors other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea\'s Trade Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s  aerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry specifically including space  activities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2 the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992 called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year again on Ariane and will be entirely made in Korea.   Uribyol-3 projected for a 1995 launch will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001 in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts) or for production of  consumer space items (among other products South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications) a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+\%  of the values included in the index are US firms this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....

' I missed the presentations given in the morning session (when Shea gave his rambling and almost inaudible presentation) but I did attend the afternoon session. The meeting was in a small conference room. The speaker was wired with a mike and there were microphones on the table for the panel members to use. Peons (like me) sat in a foyer outside the conference room and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV. In general the sound system was fair to poor and some of the other speakers (like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency) also were almost inaudible.

Josh Hopkins (jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu) replied: : Wow.  : Double wow.  Can you land a shuttle with a 5cm hole in the wall?  Personnally I don\'t know but I\'d like to try it sometime.  Programmatically yes we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole in the wall -- provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didn\'t cause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There are a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especially if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out the other side as could easily happen with a meteor strike.  But a hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately de-orbit to the next available landing site.  -- Ken Jenks NASA/JSC/GM2
'      Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the \'30\'s.  For much of the \'20\'s the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926 many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It\'s important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh Chamberlin and Levine and Byrd\'s _America_.  When it\'s time to railroad you railroad.     Not off the top of my head; I\'ll have to dig out my reference books again. However I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator\'s Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft) Orteig\'s prize Lord Northcliffe\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B
' Will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term Level 5 comes from? It sounds like the RISKS Digest  equivalent of Large Extra Large Jumbo... Or maybe it\'s like Defcon 5...

Not surprising.  But who is it that invents this standard

' [Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]   The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically.    For several reasons.  Vertical landings don\'t require miles of runway and limit noise pollution.  They don\'t require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines and touch down.  Of course as Henry pointed out vetical landings aren\'t quite that simple.   Well to be blunt yes.  But at least you\'re learning.   The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are however not especially practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings are also not very comfortable.  However in the words of Georgy Grechko I prefer to have bruises

Fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go kind of boom but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium.  If you want bomb grade plutonium use a research reactor not a power reactor.  But if you want a bomb don\'t use plutonium

'  The company was probably Public Missiles Inc of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope it\'s not illegal. It is however closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations upon request to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\' use to insure safety. Depending on motor size the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way rockets under 1 lb and powered by an F motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101 Subpart C for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50000 feet most of them only get to 2000 to 5000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute or multiple parachutes depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US where there are more obstructions.  Camera telemetry transmitter and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities the key is to practice safety. I\'ve been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years and still have all my extremities intact.   That\'s another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting but that\'s one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby

' The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years. See the discussion of high-power rocketry in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR) although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization but provided you aren\'t doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that it\'s not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care and you need a lot more empty air to fly in but it\'s basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry the high-power people use factory-built engines
'SOmebody mentioned  a re-boost of HST during this mission  meaning that Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission.  How will said re-boost be done?  Grapple HST  stow it in Cargo bay  do OMS burn to high altitude    unstow  HST   repair  gyros  costar install  fix solar arrays  then return to earth?  My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost?  why not  grapple  do all said fixes   bolt a small  liquid  fueled thruster module  to  HST   then let it make the re-boost.  it has to be cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug.   that way now that they are going to need at least 5  spacewalks  then they can carry an EDO pallet
' You\'re assuming that go solar = photovoltaic.  Solar dynamic power (turbo-alternators) doesn\'t have this problem.  It also has rather less air drag due to its higher efficiency which is a non-trivial win for big solar plants at low altitude.  Now you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.   References?  Such treaties have been *proposed* but as far as I know
'Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]        Well I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch) and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However putting a 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations in my opinion.]  [And by the way I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle for example I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at putting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than public relations in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990 when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers I remember.)  Similarly Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars for example got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie The Last Action Hero.  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations Columbia pictures has paid $500000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket its booster rockets and on the COMET payload which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch an advertising executive is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET NASA violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.   This is being disputed since the launch is a commercial launch and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL BILLBOARDS    Orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example and Robert Heinlein described another in The Man Who Sold the Moon.  Several different potential projects have been developed although none have been implemented but the most real prior to 1993 being the Eiffel II project

'    My understanding is that the \'expected errors\' are basically    known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked    that don\'t have the right values in yet because they aren\'t    set till after launch and suchlike. Rather than fix the code    and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew    \'ok if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff ignore it\'.  Good grief.

'   Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When graphed these define the \'flight envelope\' of that aircraft presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn\'t fall out of the sky.  Hence \'pushing the envelope\' becomes \'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope\'.   Note that the envelope isn\'t precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence one of the things test pilots do for a living is \'push the envelope\' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence \'pushing back\' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note too that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be \'pushed\' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans such as the \'early\' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).  I\'m sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about this process (and then some).  --  Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live  in the real world.   -- Mary Shafer
'The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth  observation and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.). So it\'s not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.  But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation? The military functions of missile spotting troop spotting etc. are well documented but what about anything else?  The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.  More importantly if radar can spot water vapour (clouds) presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers

'      I note that you make no such case as you claim can be \'even more easily made\'.  Yes the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place but there is no such term as \'government failure\' since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn\'t do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.  This libertopican bilge about \'moral arguments\' about taxation etc. is at bottom so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be \'justified\' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens.  Tripe a la Tommy the new libertopian dish.    Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?  --  Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live  in the real world.   -- Mary Shafer

'In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a \'foamed aluminum\' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking

'   There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it\'s too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs you can\'t extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn\'t expelled     is the part that\'s nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2 so even if you can get enough     oxygen in you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh and of course

'Archive-name: space/astronaut Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $  HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT      First the short form authored by Henry Spencer then an official NASA     announcement.      Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut since it\'s probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts) and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\'re better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle mission     specialist.      If you aren\'t a US citizen become one; that is a must.  After that     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA\'s problem is not finding qualified people     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical     you should be okay; if you can\'t your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you\'ve got a tough selling job ahead trying     to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And also that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job and NASA\'s image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988     43 were military or NASA employees and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss but they offer you a job     at NASA ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first.      Think space:  they want highly motivated people so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\'t make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston Texas and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy earth sciences materials     processing manufacturing) and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander the pilot     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander pilot and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle     crew mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system in extra-vehicular activities and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics mission requirements and     objectives and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities payload handling     using the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\'s     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering     biological science physical science or mathematics.        The following degree fields while related to engineering and the     sciences are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology Aviation Technology \tMedical Technology etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology Physiological \tPsychology or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography Anthropology Archaeology etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:  \tNASA Johnson Space Center \tAstronaut Selection Office \tATTN: AHX \tHouston TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications additional information may be     requested for some applicants and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center Houston     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave a retirement plan and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay benefits leave

' I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK\'s R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I\'ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :   \t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail \t\t\t-------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a \'conventional\' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating container.

'The SDIO has contracted with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).  The NRL is building the spacecraft designing the detailed mission and doing the integration and operations (with help from JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks I have left out...don\'t be mad).  I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.  As for why SDIO is doing it some of the reasons are:     1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO     2)  in LEO we don\'t get any new radiation data on the sensors we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts     3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science     4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times  I am sure there are some things I have forgotten and some I haven\'t been told but

'Archive-name: space/net Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $  NETWORK RESOURCES  OVERVIEW      You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of     computers so much of the material below may not apply to you. In     general however systems connected to \'the net\' fall in one of three     categories: Internet Usenet or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special \'servers\'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users and SPACE on BITNET) there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet \'netnews\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     \'group name\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called \'sci.space.news\' \'sci.space\' \'sci.space.shuttle\' \'sci.astro\'     and \'talk.politics.space\'. Contributors \'post\' submissions (called     \'articles\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.

'    {Description of External Tank option for SSF redesign deleted}   Yo Ken let\'s keep on-top of things! Both the External Tank and Wingless Orbiter options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped such as using the giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles and building a station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.  Currently there are three options being considered as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today\'s Times).  Option A - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC JSC and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses Bus-1 a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\'s      qualified for STS and ELV\'s. The bus provides propulsion GN&C      Communications & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A Power Station Capability is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners\' labs taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module      the U.S. habitation module and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option B - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option B team is based at LaRC and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option A). Also the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit for both options A and B.  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A Two Fault Tolerance Capability is achieved after 14 flights      with the addition of a 2nd power module another thermal      control system radiator and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights the Internationals are on-board. More power      the Habitation module and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option  with the exception of the data management system

The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally gathering gravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the mid-latitudes.  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C.  2.  An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition Experiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in equipment at the tracking station.  3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.  4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence RI

'   Lindbergh\'s flight took place in \'27 not the thirties.   Could you give examples of privately funded ones?   Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons I  suspect.  I\'m not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindbergh\'s flight.  Modern analogies
'Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches or 400000 ft or 75 Statute miles.  Now a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type or guy wires or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40\% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example let us say you have a 280000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9200 lb so at 1 mile  below the payload the total load is now 289200 lb a 3.3\% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3\% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10000000 lb of composites assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3\% mass ratio per mile the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag rockets starting from the ground have a 15\% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that

'From the JPL Universe April 23
' For the purpose of a contest I\'d bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel for re-entry any kind of heat shielding etc. etc.  Even still if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development it probably wouldn\'t be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don\'t have to pay for DC-1 development great! I\'ll use it.  But back to the contest goals there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage LEV and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay but I\'d bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...) and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious that\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs two LEVs two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a manned moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn\'t give up I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced how much lunar material it\'d need for protection from solar flares
'    In fact you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring NASA  altogether.  The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a Conestoga flying  a COMET payload.  NASA is simply the primary customer.  I believe SDIO has a small payload as well.  The advertising space was sold by the owners of the rocket who can do whatever they darn well please with it.  In addition
' Ah there\'s the rub.  And a catch-22 to boot.  For the purposes of a contest you\'ll probably not compete if\'n you can\'t afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course if a low priced system existed there might be demand...    I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example would you allow Rockwell to \'loan\' you the engines?  And so forth...   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other words perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support navigation etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.  You wouldn\'t want to use the expensive stuff forever but I\'d hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac oops I mean launch system comes on line.  I guess I\'d simplify this to say that \'waste\' is a slippery concept.  If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years then perhaps its not \'wasted\' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500 million

'McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X          HUNTINGTON BEACH Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern California day McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However recent changes in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies said Col.  Simon Pete Worden SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital objective agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents\' time.          The key is management Worden said. SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major Jess Sponable.          Although the next phase may involve more agencies Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.          SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science Space and Technology Committee. This is the direction we\'re going to have to go said Rep.  George Brown the committee\'s Democratic chairman. Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t sustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher Brown\'s Republican colleague went further. Joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. Let\'s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. On very large ventures companies put in seed money said Charles Ordahl McDonnell Douglas\' senior vice president for space systems. You need strong government investments.          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a pitch-over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles Pete Conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages
'      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speaking indicates we\'re seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now in the good old days before GRO data it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) \tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then gets large the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable and we should start to see for example the Andromeda\'s bursters. \tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is the edge of the Universe ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum) ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard but conceivable.  \tIf we know anything about physics at that level the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they\'d actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it\'s  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.  If you can think of one
'    I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--\'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics\'. Or it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers nature lovers or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.  Of course

'Speech by Pete Worden                                                Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference                                                             Colorado Springs Colorado                                                                   April 15 1993        What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster Cheaper and Better.       Faster Cheaper Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp. said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the fact that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max to remind you was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program and old faster better cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as Shape Shifter than Space Lifter.  We didn\'t spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era the 1950\'s and 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land horizontally etc etc.       I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do then you let us do the next step.

'      Phil> Didn\'t one of the early jet fighters have these?  I also think Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.  The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly descended from the NACA with space added in.  You\'ll notice that I didn\'t mention sweep wings even though the X-5 tested at what\'s now Dryden had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don\'t change their angle of sweep sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones at Langley Research Center were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s respectively).  It\'s true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force of course was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier but analog.)  Phil> Egad! I\'m disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other hand

' Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length of the daylight.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p )       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!

'Picture our universe floating like a log in a river.  As the log floats down the river it occasionally strikes rocks the bank the bottom other logs.  When this collission occurs kinetic energy is translated into heat the log degrades gets scraped up and other energy  translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log.  However to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.  This is my theory for GRB.

' Indeed so; it\'s at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible.  It is possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced by the Earth\'s rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends flowing back to equator where it is warmed and rises) and this helps just enough to make Everest- without-oxygen feasible.

' This is one of those yes but things. It\'s true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though it\'s straight-on compressive strength is high and it\'s torsional  resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member  there\'s no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature. Tree roots  are an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases.   Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don\'t think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I don\'t know much about panda thumbs so I\'ll ask is it opposable?   Well I won\'t say flat out that they can\'t be intelligent but I\'ll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don\'t think it\'s likely. First let me say that when I say intelligent I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  it\'s enviroment in a planned way it will do so. That\'s certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien.  Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but it\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\'s room for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there\'s little selection pressure for such brains. Instead a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\'t rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction.  Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it\'s internal heat is rapidly lost due to it\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it\'s time and energy feeding won\'t have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur\'s problem is the reverse it must moderate it\'s heat production  because it\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.  I\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur it\'s activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself
'   Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled Habitable Planets for Man (I think) in 1964.  It should be available in most good libraries or through inter-library loan.     It answered the questions you ask (speculatively of course) along with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies: length of day (for day/night temperature variation and agricultural concerns) partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of xenon narcosis?  neither did I) density of particulates in the atm and their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun) etc.     Climate isn\'t a global phenomenon and probably needn\'t concern you but axial tilt ought to.

THE SOVIETS AND VENUS                                      PART 3                         Copyright (c) 1993 by Larry Klaes  \tThe author gives permission to any group or individual wishing \tto distribute this article so long as proper credit is given         the author is notified and the article is reproduced in its          entirety.          To the North Pole!          On June 2 and 7 1983 two of the Soviet Union\'s mighty PROTON      rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan      Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe      for the planet Venus.           Designated VENERA 15 and 16 the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task the basic     VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core     was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by     the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The     dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to Earth.           Atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed     the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot) 300-kilogram (660-pound)     POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system possibly a     terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by      the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance would be able to map Venus\'     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).           The Soviet probes\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the     VENERAs\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300-meter (1000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the      island of Puerto Rico the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or      PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation.          On October 10 1983 after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections      VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1000 by 65000 kilometers (600 by 39000 miles) around      the planet completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA      16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\'      first polar-circling spacecraft.          Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20      for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5400 miles) long.       The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions      in July of 1984 the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers      (46 million square miles) thirty percent of the entire planet.          VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills      mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean      surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids      would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)      across due to Venus\' very dense atmosphere.          There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features.  For example the probes\'      owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the      summit of 10800-meter (35640-foot) high Maxwell Montes the tallest      mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact.  American      scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that Maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of Ishtar Terra.            In any event the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about     Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later     in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar     (VOIR) its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-     nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be      called MAGELLAN after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan      (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time however the Soviet      probes maintained that distinction.          Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted     next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the      Fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the world\'s     temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit) but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating      current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)      lower than at the equator.  In contrast the polar air above sixty      kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.          When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984 there were      plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control     gas to perform the operation.            VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985 leaving      the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six      hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.          Venus by Balloon          For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\'s mantle of      air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of      the French space agency Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967 only to have a joint      French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless      late in the year 1984 such dreams would eventually come true.          When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21      the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear full      views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe      since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.          The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named     VEGA 1 and 2 a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei     being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore namely the comet Halley.            This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.     Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to Earth.            Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system.  Some like Halley are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the Sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter.          The Soviet Union along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and     Japan\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical     GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet while Japan\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and      SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.           Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However government budget     cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to     make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of      data from other nations though an instrument named the Dust Counter      and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA) designed by Chicago University Professor      John Simpson was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.          The Soviets\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission the Soviets decided to modify     their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus     the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley much as the      U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.      The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley helping to pinpoint the      location of the comet\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.          As planned the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander     making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers     (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)     altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had     successfully arrived.           One kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was     pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon inflating it to a     diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen     meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package properly known as     an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter electronics     and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planet\'s atmosphere.           The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just     north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.       This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.       The author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975 when Soviet scientists      had thought the planet\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover.          The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering 11600     kilometers (6960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer     (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     (thirty miles) for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the     journey.  The layer\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius     (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.     The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.           Early in the first balloon\'s flight the VEGA 1 lander was already     headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13      and 14 in 1982.  However VEGA 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia the     Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6      miles) above the surface.           There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never      before been directly examined.  Nevertheless the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees      Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\'s      56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.          As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and      12 had failed in December of 1978 the Soviets focused on the data     returned during the lander\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The     French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine      and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active      volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.     The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)     contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.          The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.     The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\'s results     nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were      three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles)      much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-     cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air      over the last seven years.          When the lander and balloon finally went silent the last      functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission the flyby bus sailed on     for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around     the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March     6 1986 the bus made a 8890-kilometer (5334-mile) pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.     The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel.          On June 13 VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for     a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate the VEGA 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet.  During its 11100-kilometer (6660-mile)     flight over Venus the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.     After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-     kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the continent of Aphrodite      Terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5      miles) towards the surface.          Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius      (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1     balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed      through the balloon\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon and the second aerostat\'s nephelometer      failed to function.          The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite     Terra\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June 1500 kilometers (900     miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\'s resting place was smoother     than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite      rare on Earth but present in Luna\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured      463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres     essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.          Far above the VEGA 2 lander its carrier bus sped past Venus at     a distance of 24500 kilometers (14700 miles) and followed its twin      to comet Halley making a closer flyby on March 9 1986 at just 8030      kilometers (4818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers      (8.4 miles) across rotating once every 53 hours give or take three      hours.          Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley     encounters Soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-     Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly the Soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.       VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.          Future Plans Diverted          The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission planned for     the early 1990s.          This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft      would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\'s      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over      the VEGA balloons\' two days.  The mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible      landing on Vesta (thus the mission name) the most reflective Main      Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.          Unfortunately for Venus exploration plans began to change in     the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA     mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space      program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this      class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next      year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     Mars\' largest moon Phobos.           All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions     including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and      eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.     The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future.          But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars     exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions     one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in March of 1989.           In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have     since been put forth a sad commentary after twenty-five years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet.           During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began      to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations particularly those in the West.  While the      culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market.          These effects hit everywhere including the space program.     Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money.            In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for      sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price      of 1.6 million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United      States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.          MAGELLAN and GALILEO           The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4 1989.     Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft a combination of     spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When     MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990 it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters (360 feet) surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.          In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space      Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18 1989 the Shuttle      ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space      named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the      probe\'s primary target\'s major moons in 1610.          In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on     a direct flight to the Jovian planet the probe was sent around     Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     Jupiter.  As a result Venus became GALILEO\'s first planetary     goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the     planet\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere.          On the Drawing Boards          With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-     tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet      Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1      1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions      within in the next decade.  Japan India and the ESA have also     considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.          In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects      as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected     for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air     temperature and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe designed     to study Venus\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute much as the Soviets had done since 1967.     Final project decisions will be made in 1994.          Humans on Venus                Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?     At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into     changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like     Earth\'s.  However it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability      to speed up the planet\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries     if not millennia.          In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?     Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found     through international cooperation including the nation which      made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

'    _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely    no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have    to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to    conventional Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching    by comets it\'s got too many holes in it to count but at    least it was a good try...  So you have a plausible model for GRB\'s at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis which had a lot of problems anyhow.  We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models.  A paper on the possibility of GRB\'s in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this paper send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line    get 9304001   Here is the abstract of that paper.     The currently favored explanation for the origin of GRBs puts them    at cosmological distances;    but as long as there is no distance    indicator to these events all possible sources which are    isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is    why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list    although there is no known mechanism for generating GRBs    from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem the possibility that GRBs    originate in the solar cometary cloud    cannot be excluded until it is disproved.     We use the available data on the distribution of GRBs (the BATSE    catalogue up to March 1992) and    the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to    investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations    between the angular distributions of GRBs and comets\' aphelia    assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect    at least to some extent
'  Actually both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction of the acceleration.  For pilots accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you\'re facing (pulling out from a steep dive the acceleration will force blood toward your feet for instance).  In this case you can only put up with about 8 g\'s even with a pressure suit.    The record for acceleration though is measured along the direction you\'re facing (for lack of a better term).  As I recall
' Well here goes.  The first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared to football and baseball the average joe schmoe doesn\'t seem interested or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education.  All of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world.  The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space.  I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to  succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld (i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.  So I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs.  In essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet

INTRODUCTION       From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these objects planets meaning wanderers and named them after Roman deities -- Jupiter king of the gods; Mars the god of war; Mercury messenger of the gods; Venus the god of love and beauty and Saturn father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.       Science flourished during the European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were calculated. In the 17th century astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries.       But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\'s gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planets.       The United States has sent automated spacecraft then human-crewed expeditions to explore the Moon. Our automated machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the Sun\'s environment; observed comets and made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune.       These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.       Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century.        AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s (NASA\'s) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives the craft share much in common.       Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission supported by basic subsystems for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well as for processing data and communicating with Earth.       Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power.       Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft.       The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\'s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference flight controllers can keep a spacecraft\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.       Between 1959 and 1971 NASA spacecraft were dispatched to study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury Venus and Mars. These three worlds and our own are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition.       For the early planetary reconnaissance missions NASA employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. Between 1962 and 1975 seven Mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.       All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies.       Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus spacecraft weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds) to the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter weighing in at 974 kilograms (2147 pounds) their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft for example had originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.       In 1972 NASA launched Pioneer 10 a Jupiter spacecraft. Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.       Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system. Because of the distances involved these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations. Barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\'s light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.       NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters -- descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers from Earth and then studied martian features from above.       Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planet\'s dense cloud cover to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments -- radioed information about the planet\'s atmosphere during their descent toward the surface.       A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including Magellan Galileo Ulysses Mars Observer the Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet.        The Sun       A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system; all of the planets moons asteroids comets dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the material left over from the Sun\'s formation. One hundred and nine Earths would be required to fit across the Sun\'s disk and its interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.       As a star the Sun generates energy through the process of fusion. The temperature at the Sun\'s core is 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit) and the pressure there is 340 billion times Earth\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\'s surface temperature of 5500 degrees Celsius (10000 degrees Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature. At the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium producing energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles both extending far beyond the planets.       The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At the end of its life the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up ultimately growing so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf -- the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.       Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\'s environment but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11 the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft launched on October 6 1990 is a joint solar mission of NASA and the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\'s gravity to change its trajectory Ulysses will fly over the Sun\'s polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.       We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If it were different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have developed on Earth.        Mercury       Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft launched on November 3 1973 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a journey of nearly five months which included a flyby of Venus the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the solar system\'s innermost planet on March 29 1974.       Until Mariner 10 little was known about Mercury. Even the best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is visible on Earth\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar telescopes gave any hint of Mercury\'s surface conditions prior to the voyage of Mariner 10.       The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling our own Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. These apparently were created when Mercury\'s interior cooled and shrank buckling the planet\'s crust. The cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310 miles).       Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of Earth\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon neon and helium. When the planet\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit) on Mercury\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1170 degrees Fahrenheit) -- is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time.       Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the Sun!        Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would make Mercury\'s core larger proportionally than the Moon\'s core or those of any of the planets.       After the initial Mercury encounter Mariner 10 made two additional flybys -- on September 21 1974 and March 16 1975 -- before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated; as a result we still have not seen one-half of the planet\'s surface.        Venus       Veiled by dense cloud cover Venus -- our nearest planetary neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2 spacecraft launched on August 27 1962 was the first of more than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\' surface romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest.       On December 14 1962 Mariner 2 passed within 34839 kilometers (21648 miles) of Venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5 launched in June 1967 flew much closer to the planet. Passing within 4094 kilometers (2544 miles) of Venus on the second American flyby Mariner 5\'s instruments measured the planet\'s magnetic field ionosphere radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury Mariner 10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.       In the spring and summer of 1978 two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4 of the same year the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.       Five days later the five separate components making up the second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The four small independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour.       Venus resembles Earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet. However spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For example Venus\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward) compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other planets.       Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\' atmosphere (95 times as dense as Earth\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of Earth\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\' atmosphere acts like a greenhouse permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space. As a result the planet\'s average surface temperature is 482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit) hot enough to melt lead.       A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet\'s dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet. NASA\'s Magellan spacecraft launched on May 5 1989 has been in orbit around Venus since August 10 1990. The spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images of the surface.       Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes a mountain the size of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\'s flank is a 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are named for women; Maxwell Montes Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.       Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock which cracks just about everywhere preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the San Andreas Fault in California.       Venus\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\' slow rotation of 243 Earth days whereas Earth\'s winds blow in both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternating bands. Venus\' atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather.        Earth       As viewed from space our world\'s distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters brown and green land masses and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor life Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.       Our planet\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\'s atmosphere protects us from meteors as well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the other newly formed planets it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system.       From our journeys into space we have learned much about our home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31 1958 and discovered an intense radiation zone now called the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding Earth.       Since then other research satellites have revealed that our planet\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. We\'ve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believed calm and uneventful seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.       Besides affecting Earth\'s weather solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\'s magnetic field they collide with air molecules above our planet\'s magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.       Satellites about 35789 kilometers (22238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of Earth\'s complex weather systems.       From their unique vantage points satellites can survey Earth\'s oceans land use and resources and monitor the planet\'s health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways.        The Moon       The Moon is Earth\'s single natural satellite. The first human footsteps on an alien world were made by American astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo expeditions NASA dispatched the automated Ranger Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.       NASA\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds) and consisting of more than 2000 separate samples.       From this material and other studies scientists have constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy. Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\'s existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain. As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode Island or Delaware and their collisions with the Moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across.       This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) below the surface. Then for the next 700 million years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the surface flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that Galileo Galilei an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance called maria meaning seas.       As far as we can tell there has been no significant volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years. Since then the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion years ago they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today. Thousands of years from now the footsteps left by the Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.       The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet\'s gravity or it was the result of a collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars. The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.        Mars       Of all the planets Mars has long been considered the solar system\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938 when Orson Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.       Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\'s surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.       So far six American missions to Mars have been carried out. Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.       Mariner 4 launched in late 1964 flew past Mars on July 14 1965 coming within 9846 kilometers (6118 miles) of the surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the planet the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide.       On May 30 1971 the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off only to find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the storm cleared Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7329 pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface etching river valleys and flood plains.       In August and September 1975 the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet including Is there life there? Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.       Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20 1976 while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos sent back from the Chryse Planitia (Plains of Gold) showed a bleak rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia Planitia on September 3 1976 it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible dunes.       The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\'s soil chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure but the Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there.       The Viking Landers became weather stations recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.       The lowest temperature -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2 site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms but because the atmosphere is so thin wind force is minimal. Viking Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.       The martian atmosphere like that of Venus is primarily carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1000 as much water as our air but even this small amount can condense out forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys.       There is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines gorges riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.       Mars has two moons Phobos and Deimos. They are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surfaces. It is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.       The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days respectively. The first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2 which stopped operating on July 24 1978 when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas. Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12 1980 when it was shut down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on August 7 1980 when the last of its attitude-control gas was used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13 1983.       Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology experiments we know more about Mars than any other planet except Earth. NASA\'s Mars Observer spacecraft to be launched in September 1992 will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.         Asteroids       The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as asteroids or minor planets. Most but not all are found in a band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth\'s path and there is evidence that Earth has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow Arizona.       Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More likely asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet. In fact if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object the object would be only about 1500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the diameter of our Moon.        Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It is estimated that 100000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through Earth-based telescopes.       Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the meteoroid does not burn up completely what\'s left strikes Earth\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.       Of all the meteorites examined 92.8 percent are composed of silicate (stone) and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks.       Since asteroids are material from the very early solar system scientists are interested in their composition. Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances.       Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter launched by NASA in October 1989 will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s the CRAF and Cassini missions are a collaborative project of NASA the European Space Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy as well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy. One day space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials.        Jupiter       Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt in the outer regions of our solar system lie the giant planets of Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune. In 1972 NASA dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter was the first port of call.       Pioneer 10 which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in March 1972 was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In December 1973 it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter flying within 132252 kilometers (82178 miles) of the planet\'s banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979.       These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize Jupiter\'s atmosphere.       It is likely that methane ammonia water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. Because of Jupiter\'s atmospheric dynamics however these organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.       The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\'s atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a high-pressure region the Great Red Spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a million years old.       Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\'s upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\'s northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint narrow ring encircling Jupiter.       Largest of the solar system\'s planets Jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey around the Sun. With 16 known moons Jupiter is something of a miniature solar system.       A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once past Venus twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two asteroids the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into Jupiter\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to Jupiter\'s large moons exploring in detail what the two Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.        Galilean Satellites       In 1610 Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first time humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of their discoverer these four bodies would become known as the Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet-sized satellites.       One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io. Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on Io with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\'s surface.       Io\'s pizza-colored terrain marked by orange and yellow hues is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between Io Jupiter and the other three Galilean moons.       Europa approximately the same size as our Moon is the brightest Galilean satellite. The moon\'s surface displays a complex array of streaks indicating the crust has been fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io Europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt -- apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space. Europa\'s core is made of rock that sank to its center.       Like Europa the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock. Ganymede\'s surface has areas of different brightness indicating that in the past material oozed out of the moon\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface.       Callisto only slightly smaller than Ganymede has the lowest density of any Galilean satellite suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.       Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be performed by the Galileo Orbiter.        Saturn       No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds Saturn\'s atmosphere has a more subtle butterscotch hue and its markings are muted by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\'s somewhat placid-looking appearance scientists were surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1770 kilometers (1100 miles) per hour.       Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979 returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in November 1980 sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\'s ring system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in August 1981.       The rings are composed of countless low-density particles orbiting individually around Saturn\'s equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.       The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\'s gravity. A third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet.       Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings.       Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from Saturn\'s ring system rather than its atmosphere where no lightning was observed. As they had at Jupiter the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\'s auroras near Saturn\'s poles.       The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons shepherd ring particles maintaining Saturn\'s rings and the gaps in the rings. Saturn\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.        Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\'s in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and Venus. Titan\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge. Unfortunately Voyager\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\'s dense clouds.       Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting Titan\'s methane to ethane acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth between three and four billion years ago. However Titan\'s atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.       The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called Huygens which will be dropped into Titan\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through Titan\'s clouds and will spend years examining the Saturnian system.        Uranus       In January 1986 four and a half years after visiting Saturn Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet\'s discovery over two centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.       Uranus third largest of the planets is an oddball of the solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of Pluto) this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system. During Voyager 2\'s flyby the south pole faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system.       Voyager 2 found that Uranus\' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\'s center a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of Djakarta on the island of Java in Indonesia.       Uranus\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia methane and water vapor. The planet\'s blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour and temperatures near the cloud tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).       Uranus\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the planet\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow.       Approximately 8000 kilometers (5000 miles) below Uranus\' cloud tops there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10000 kilometers (6200 miles) deep. Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.       Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) in diameter orbiting Uranus. The five previously known -- Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1610 kilometers (323 to 1000 miles) across. Representing a geological showcase these five moons are half-ice half-rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity including faulting and ice flows.       The most remarkable of Uranus\' moons is Miranda. Its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons crater-pocked plains and winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that after the moon formed it was smashed apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface.       Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged 11. In contrast to Saturn\'s rings which are composed of bright particles Uranus\' rings are primarily made up of dark boulder-sized chunks.        Neptune       Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of Neptune and the planet\'s moons. On August 25 1989 the spacecraft swept to within 4850 kilometers (3010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton. During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\'s atmosphere was more active than Uranus\'.        Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot a circular storm the size of Earth in Neptune\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\'s Great Red Spot the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the Scooter as well as high-altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any planet were observed up to 2400 kilometers (1500 miles) per hour.       Like the other giant planets Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\'s core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants. Neptune\'s distinctive blue appearance like Uranus\' blue color is due to atmospheric methane.       Neptune\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\'s spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is similar to Uranus\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal. Earth\'s magnetic field on the other hand is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.       Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\'s rings. Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected these arcs but they were in fact part of thin complete rings. A number of small moons could explain the arcs but such bodies were not spotted.       Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in 1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid but since Proteus orbits close to Neptune it was lost in the planet\'s glare for observers on Earth.        Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in astronomical terms) the moon will be so close that Neptunian gravity will tear it apart forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet\'s modest current rings.       Triton\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at Saturn and Uranus. Triton\'s mantle is probably composed of water-ice but the moon\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain: the so-called cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap.        Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers (1 to 5 miles). Triton\'s thin atmosphere only 1/70000th as thick as Earth\'s has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius -391 degrees Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited.        Pluto       Pluto is the most distant of the planets yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside Neptune\'s orbit where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until March 1999. Pluto\'s orbit is also highly inclined -- tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.       Discovered in 1930 Pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball. The planet\'s diameter is calculated to be approximately 2300 kilometers (1430 miles) only two-thirds the size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\'s surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\'s spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees.        The planet has one known satellite Charon discovered in 1978. Charon\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\'s: the moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\'s and Charon\'s rotational period and Charon\'s period of revolution are all 6.4 Earth days.        Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto NASA is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.        Comets       The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star.       Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across and is made principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets.       As these materials boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloud-like head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet\'s tails. Gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus but dust particles are pushed more slowly. As the nucleus continues in its orbit the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc.       Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in effect the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun. The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in length but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets -- from the Latin cometa meaning long-haired -- are essentially dramatic light shows.       Some comets pass through the solar system only once but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system.       Halley\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\' orbit. Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley because he plotted the comet\'s orbit and predicted its return based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name became part of astronomical lore when in 1759 the comet returned on schedule. Unfortunately Sir Edmond did not live to see it.       A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately on its most recent appearance Halley\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was visible to the naked eye especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so bright on rare occasions that they were visible during daytime. Historically comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.       The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed; the first was NASA\'s International Cometary Explorer in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese two Soviet and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by Halley\'s Comet in 1986.        Conclusion       Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959 spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space.        We have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large as small planets flown by comets and sampled the solar environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects.       The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets moons asteroids and comets and comparing differences and similarities we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.       We are also gaining insight into Earth\'s complex weather systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the Sun\'s activity and its influence throughout the solar system we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on Earth.       We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future missions are planned for Mars Saturn a comet and the asteroid belt.       We can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not been back to the Moon since December 1972 plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian outposts.

'   From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet the instrument payload constraints are:     Mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)     Power allocation - 6 watts     Required instruments: \tVisible imaging system (1024x1024 CCD 750 mm fl f/10 optics) \tIR mapping spectrometer (256x256 HgCdTe array 0.3\% energy resolution) \tUV spectrometer (55-200 nm 0.5 nm resolution) \tRadio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system) \t\tultrastable means 10^-14.  This doesn\'t leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated to the  mission of the spacecraft.  In addition the power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator and the whole space craft will be about 2 feet in diameter with no booms which means there will be strong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the background which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.  It would still be nice

Given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx. 2 arcmin we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map\'s accuracy.

' I\'d hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal too large (if the new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds the S/C mass will drop to 110-120 kg) or too expensive ($400 million [FY92 $] for two S/C) especially when compared to other NASA planetary missions.   This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and the require minimal delta-v from the mother ship.  A mission to the main belt might be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C each visiting a seperate asteroid and then returning to the main S/C.  After analysis the main S/C would then be targeted for the most interesting object for further study.  Now

' Reboost may not be a problem if they have enough fuel.  If they don\'t do a  reboost this time they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing mission.  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the  back and you could have problems.  The shuttle just isn\'t designed to land  with that much weight in the payload.   of course that is a concern too and the loss of science during the time that it is on the ground.  plus a fear that if it comes down some big-wig might not allow it to go back up.  but the main concern I believe is the danger of the landing.  Just to add another bad vibe they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  Finally  this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and service a space station.

' There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise there is no particular plan period.  This is a large part of the problem.  In this context it\'s not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini.   It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is 1950s-vintage) propulsion.   Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things that can\'t be

'(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)    Yesterday in response to Henry Spencer\'s question about the  temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space I said Dust grains acts as blackbodies and they\'re at 40-150 K.  Well I was dead wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert Bruce Draine has informed me that dust grains _aren\'t_ good radiators in the far IR which is why they are so warm; actually the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry Henry and anyone else I misled.  Obviously time for me to take another ISM class :-(    In other news Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1 mass ratio about 15:1 or so plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is  that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn but many accreted into the gas giants especially Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller already-existing Neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].    He notes that the two recently discovered Kuiper Belt objects 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW plus Chiron and Pholus are all about the same  mass and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon he thinks formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth\'s moon.  There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost Charon doesn\'t) which can be used as evidence for the impact theory.    He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\'s  orbit beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found in his model.  Note that such bodies will be very dark since if their surfaces are covered with methane  frost it will have photolyzed into very dark long-chain hydrocarbons by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5 I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate and when the atmosphere freezes out again thirty years later it forms bright new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see.    I hope I haven\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake it\'s undoubtedly mine not his.    By the way he\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission (I think) and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He\'d like to use a Proton which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes launched separately) or $120 Million for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each

'   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few years ago.  The question was if an alien spacecraft landed in Washington D.C. what was the proper organization to deal with it: The State Department (alien ambassadors) the Defense Department (alien invaders) the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens) the Department of the Interior (new non-human species) etc.  It was very much a question of our perception of the aliens not of anything intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral person i.e. a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a person.  The paper was quite interesting as I recall.     I think you\'d have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the culture.  This may not always be wrong

'Ken:  Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big Boys if you\'re tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs too.  Good luck son.   Ahem.  The Russians are in the Free World now or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend so.   It will be tough to make DC-X succeed and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it\'s the *only* chance we have now or will have for a *long* time to come to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.    There is no Shuttle successor in funded development NASP is dwindling away and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren\'t gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the er Free World\'s available space cash.  As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:  DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental X-plane hardware. It\'s been to my mind incredibly successful already-- they\'ve built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America never mind flying the thing getting a successor funded or building the DC-Y.  I\'m sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics.  I don\'t see a realistic  prospect for beating down those costs for multi-ton payloads anywhere else.  If the DC flops it\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties a prospect too depressing to bear.  (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction.  It doesn\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks.  It\'s creating its own market for small payloads.)  I read the magazines and I\'ve attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems some of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today\'s world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line.  [...deleting some things I\'m not going to prove tonight...]  Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References please.  The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations as well as the bird in the hand argument your common sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all it flies alongside the Shuttle not instead of it.  Also of course DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.   If a DC-X successor can fly a 10000-kg payload for $1M or even $5M rather than the $40M it now costs more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money you can fly several satellites instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.

' Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The large grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency.  However at temperatures below 100 K 90\% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns where radiating efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed.  Moreover the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In the extreme limit grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation.  Worse still IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average temperature.  A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K) thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K) and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13 4E-8 and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane.  To find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then take the fourth root.  In the table below starlight comes from Allen\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be cooked if that were the case.  In any event the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background and I believe that to be correct.)                           Dilution   Temp.

' My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday but  got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering  the confusing spitting contest over \'rights\' (there are TOO  inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive  of liberty as a despot) I suspect that my post did not get out  of my site.    (I ain\'t saying that dark skies are included in these  rights although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.)     Anyway here are my thoughts on this:    I\'d like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend getting away from it all (paved roads indoor plumbing  malls ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night - wow!)  I don\'t watch  commercial television but I can imagine just how disgusting beer  truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven) at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid  even if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved.   Regards

'[Stuff deleted]  Would Mr. Hart please explain how one could get every nation on earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the night sky without `coercion\'.   Remember that not every nation follows the English common law.   In most countries for most of history it was probably true that the rulers `owned\' everything not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America where by the principle enunciated the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn\'t noticed there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what. Of course if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked such a proposal might work but it would hardly be non-coercive.

' I\'m not sure if this is a big issue but it seems to me like it might be -- up till now all >1g forces applied to the mirror and its mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the telescope\'s optical axis and against the mirror\'s base.

'Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it\'s an old canard in the space business called trolling for billionaires) there is a good chance that a much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the Back to the Moon bill put together by the people who passed the Launch Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.   Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program as the Delta Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million).

' RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.    After all the space walking  they are going to  re-boost the HST\'s orbit.  I think right now  it\'s sitting  at 180 miles up they would like  220.  I don\'t know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.   Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It\'s mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.  THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn\'t light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it\'s own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle for a given orbital change.    From what i understand  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can\'t even carry extra Suits or MMU\'s.  Now if they used a small tug  I would bet  just a wild guess that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet  extra suits  more consumables  parts for the flaky FGS sensor  parts for the balky solar  electronics  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing and longer drag life.   a Whatever it is

'   This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizing events.  Rather the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event then it must be easily formed.  The *inference* was that life originated before and was destroyed but there was no evidence of that.  However even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions (say a certain composition of the atmosphere) that do not last for long.  So perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so
'Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight to the human being.  I love this topic as some of you regulars know.  So having seen Henry\'s encouraging statement about starting to talk about it; I shall.  I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent  as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and  probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the world\'s space effort.  I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves but also with others through print media.  A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to  compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration.  Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition

' I am familiar with the project.  It is the Onboard Shuttle Flight Software Project.  This software controls the Space Shuttle During all dynamic phases as well as on-orbit.

There may be an article in the IBM Systems Journal Late \'93 early \'94.  There is no magic formula.

' I like this statement though for my own reasons.  Cost comparisons depend a lot on whether the two options are similar and *then* it becomes very revealing to consider what their differences are.  Can Soyuz launch the Long Exposure Facility?  Course not.  Will the Shuttle take my television  relay to LEO by year\'s end?  Almost certainly not but the Russians are pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule.

'We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System) which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth\'s atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from off the shelf technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:  1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are there multiple authorites i.e. military and civilian?  2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies?  3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth

'    You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost and you don\'t want to clip off the panels each time.  For the Gamma-Ray Observatory one of the design requirements was that there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs explosive squibs gas shocks etc.) used for deployment.

'The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....  Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign based on information provided by NASA headquarters.  The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called Bus-1 spacecraft the orbiter and Spacelab.  The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option from initial Research Capability to Human-Tended Capability to Permanent Human Presence Capability to Two Fault Tolerance and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system Crew Health Care System and ECLSS and a major change to the Data Management System.  Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.  Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab.  Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  Two Fault Tolerance achieved in 11 flights would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules thermal control and propulsion systems.  The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights to bring up the habitat module a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.  Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not by itself meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management contractor non-hardware early utilization and operations costs he said.  ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation.  The module 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long would provide 26000 cubic feet of pressured volume separated into 7 decks connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules and other elements.  This can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee Bryan O\'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.  Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev and V. A. Yatsenko also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense the Design Bureau SALYUT the Institute of Biomedical Problems the Ministry of Foreign Affairs NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system docking systems the Proton launch vehicle Mir operations and utilization and the Soyuz TM spacecraft.  The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5.  Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  As part of its work  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations utilization maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  What\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee to be held May 3.  Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis

'  This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior to us being able to get there one might conclude that they would be more advanced and therefore more intelegent that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there is life chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have no clue as to weather they are intelegent or not.   That\'s a good point I hadn\'t thought of it that way.  My question however was more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night. Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn\'t resolved these issues on our own?   But... Your comment brings up another good question.

Prior to our attempt to civilize them the native american culture had very little crime no homelessnes no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and more.

' Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By  the time they could make the Earth\'s sky look like Las Vegas  the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as 5000 kg in a Low Earth advertising orbit: Very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard therefore. If such ads were to become common place that would have to be a very low price...  The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very  pristine...   There\'s always been a problem of having to get  away from civilization before you can really find natural scenery. 100 years ago this usually didn\'t take a trip of over 5 miles. Today most people would have to go 100 miles or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit that essentially means that no place on Earth is still wild. While that may or may not be a good thing the orbital billboards aren\'t the problem: They are just a symptom of  growing densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky because by the time  such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights where you can _see_ the stars...    An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless since you need a telescope to see them. However I\'d love to see them get all the publicity they could from underwritting the Coca Cola Io Orbital Mapping Probe.

'I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans. I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.

IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on both Mac\'s PC\'s and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis  capability.  Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation studies along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There are tons of applications with the ability to create virtual instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the addition of IEEE-488 support the computer becomes a virtual control station

'    I would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong he did  definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it was Descartes who said that All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.  If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime that\'s simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher.  Regarding Nietzsche he\'s one of the most entertaining although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now.  They\'ll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.  As for modern philosophers I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately they maintained his errors and  amplified them over time).  I would say that the most influential american philosopher would have to be Dewey.  But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was American

'Pennicillin if i have everything correct  was a highly valuable Myco-toxin  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It\'s immediate administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially enormously expensive to culture  within 3 years the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude and within 10 years  was  not much more expensive then aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections.  Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised amazing results for Toxic shock a rapidly fatal disease. It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and developement  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times of administration  and costs $2000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. The drug thus costs $10000 per useful case  and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients.  I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin

'I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases. The idea behind the statement is as follows:       if you smack two neutron       stars together or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole       a lot of energy is released enough for a gamma-ray burst at a       cosmological distance. But so the reasoning continues this energy        is released below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes       thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.       The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal so this model must       be wrong. As so often the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst but the \'fireball\' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding  medium a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball by the way is the  so-called \'failed supernovae\' scenario by Stan Woosley in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers but the flux may be more strongly beamed so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario.  On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must  ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work
'Dale sez;  I don\'t buy it.  If the things had no value at all people wouldn\'t spend money to make them. So their lack of value is just your opinion not an actual fact which is neither a philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them.  On the other hand I lived in OakBrook IL for a while where zoning laws prohibit billboards as you mention above.  I think it was a fine law despite it\'s contradictory basis.  I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would be violation of private property.  I bought this house out in the boondocks specifically to enjoy my hobby amateur astronomy.

'  I can\'t see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) mothership except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago I did some calculations on a Grand Tour space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the timeI felt  that the idea of a big mother ship had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\'s?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society\'s Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard\'s Star - i.e. a large bus spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The bus could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the real Voyagers and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did but in addition two sub-probes could have been relased at Saturn examining that planet\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small swarm of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a  small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy  well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money

'Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my  question about which countries engage in space surveillance.  Unfortunately I apparently didn\'t make the meaning of the message  clear since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance  rather than space surveillance        What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at  the Earth (satellite reconnaissance)  but _was_ which countries have  programs to detect and track (i.e. determine the orbital elements of)  satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).       The US uses missile-defense radars supplemented by a fascinating  quasi-radar operated by the Navy to do this for satellites in LEO and  electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5000 km or so.  The FEE I understand does much the same thing.

' I disagree.  It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight but sees it as an elitist activity.  Not one which he is ever going to participate in.   Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document you\'ll need a more general publication.   As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems engineering the microworld isn\'t the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic chemical biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently.  For example the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have to orbit a farm.  Well that\'s obviously not very efficient so we use  technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of  using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don\'t have the answers to.  Like in  dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other but in  hydroponics it turns out that you can\'t do that.  The lettuce growth is  stunted when it\'s grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So  now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that\'s what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together.  That\'s where we are now.   First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation. This could be useful especially if we make it available on the net.  Then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.   Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search  first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data base itself could be useful for future engineers.  That\'s my response Ken

' I don\'t know.  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is budgeted for the altitude change?  Henry  any figures on the mass  (full)  for the EDO pallet  plus it\'s dry weight?  How about for the dry mass of Bus-1?  it was being de-classified as i checked last.  Also I need.  1)  current orbital parameters of HST   2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.  3)  Discovery\'s  DRY weight  4) HST\'s Dry weight.    So how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow I think 2-3 moths should be adequate.   Also because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.   The HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.   There comes a time in every project to kill the management.  They can if neccessary re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is not a drop dead date unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.      I suspect the BUS-1 may not have enough basic thrust for the HST re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks  or bigger thrusters.   My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not a contingency.  My understanding is the mission  needs both a new FOC  and work on the electrical system  plus another re-boost.      Somehow i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then $500 million.  and the extra stuff is real cheap.  NASA has lots of suits  MMU\'s and the EDO pallets are re-usable.  Oh one double magnum of champagne now there\'s a couple hundred bucks.      That door has cycled X times already.  Once after massive G loading.

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic    \'edged\' distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or    part of the Oort cloud.     Why couldn\'t they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge    of the gravisphere? I know there isn\'t any mechanism for them but there    isn\'t a mechanism for the others either.  What on Earth is the gravisphere? Anyway before it\'s decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector as does Ulysses they  detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances. In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.  _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to conventional Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets it\'s got too many holes in it to count

'  they weren\'t even carrying extra suits.  So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That\'s the critical question. My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10900 kg of propellant.  Of that a  substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn the reentry burn and the reserve.  So Pat tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS-1 and extra parts are going mass.  If you can make the numbers work out _then_ I\'ll be interested.  After you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the EDO pallet BUS-1 and extra equipment is going to cost.       First while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning that was because they _had_ to.  They don\'t like to do that as a general rule.  Second remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn\'t designed to do that.   Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.  Third they don\'t have eight months.  They have however much time is left  after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it approved. You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it\'s realistic.  I\'m not saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).   What I\'m saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA management.    All they have to do is soup it up?  Just what does that mean?       The second servicing mission is a contingency.  You have neither shown that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your plan.     No Pat I haven\'t forgotten.   No Pat.  That\'s $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement  costs minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.    I\'m sure that if you reread this you\'ll see that your argument is falacious.   Pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that\'s _made_ to  perform this task it also ignores the point.

'Well I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off.  Given that I am not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist  i\'ll have to boil it down a bit.  1)  ALl the data on bursts to date  shows a smooth random distribution.  2)  that means they aren\'t concentrated in  galactic cores our or someone elses.  3) If the distribution is smooth  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY large phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena \tOR we are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud  but then it needs some potent little energy source  that isn\'t detectable  by any other current methods.  4)  we know it\'s not real close  like  slightly extra solar  because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.  5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string  impacts or something like that.  So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.  what i am wondering  is this in people\'s opinion  A NEW Physics problem.

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II.

Japan\'s 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes will work in the infrared yes but they are _visible light_ telescopes!  And haven\'t you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research was done with Star Wars funding and some is now being shared with astronomers.  This shows great promise.

'People who criticize big Government and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology.  Basically the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term.    (Historically this role for the U.S. Gov\'t was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors the U.S. Gov\'t has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)  As a Republican I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should drive technology and the world would be a better place for it.  But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously or some countries would have subsidized R&D while others would not.  So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations doesn\'t it?)  But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new technology and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money it makes little sense to try to save money.  Of course we could always spend our money more wisely but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be.    It\'s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts CP/M and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools.    -- Ken Jenks NASA/JSC/GM2

'Hello netters     I\'m new to this board and I thought this might be the best place for my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies the CIA utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa. The photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My question is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS.  And while the SAS was in action the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley VA.  The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.

'I haven\'t seen any mention of this in a while so here goes...  When the Hubble Telescope was first deployed one of its high gain antennas was not able to be moved across its full range of motion.  It was suspected that it had been snagged on a cable or something.  Operational procedures were modified to work around the problem and later problems have overshadowed the HGA problem.  Is there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission to determine the cause of its limited range of motion?  Is the affected HGA still limited

'We`ve had the the Great Western the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps you`ll get round to it eventually.  The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern which broke the \'Little Giant\' financially and otherwise was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel with primary steam propulsion it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale while drag rose with the square so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling.  Unfortunately there was no real market for such a beast at the time and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster said it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book How the World was One [ I think that`s right ]  If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder it would not be entirely ignoble but I doubt if history will be so charitable.

' Jonathan interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I\'d be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think.  As for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest where they began the ascent of our planet\'s highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance because if you or I tried to go to 20000 feet and exert ourselves we would probably pass out get altitude sick and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren\'t in front of me).  Usually at a certain point the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter as I am not a diving expert).  Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth\'s atmospheric density).  In addition the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically you would need a  pressure suit there

' The artist renderings that I\'ve seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree angle to the Shuttle.

However it doesn\'t  appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.  Thanks for the input on GRO\'s S/A design constraints.  That would  explain the similar design on UARS.   Heck the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind. The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement for the instrument module on EUVE.

'A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland     on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright luminous     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near     Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part     was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They     were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became     enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle     of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby     forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were     visible till morning sunrise.      The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in     Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in     the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was     only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.     A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a     spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about     five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the     upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of     the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright     spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails     were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still     visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.      The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don\'t know if     there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near     Arkhangelsk but this may be a rocket experiment too.

'    This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and no    anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far    as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.    That\'s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution    to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well    known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)    are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...  Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy except it doesn\'t explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production which makes a plasma which thermalizes the energy) it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs) it happens too fast compared to the burst duration and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars.  Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars but that uses pretty far-out physics.  My point is that we don\'t have a good mechanism at any distance so GRB\'s are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism so we can\'t rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren\'t quite right but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks if the Tunguska Meteorite was a mini-black hole collision with the earth then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well.  The fact that we don\'t know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn\'t a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB\'s.  If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud
'Hello out there
': >Why not build a inflatable space dock.  : If you\'re doing large-scale satellite servicing being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future to the point of justifying development of such a thing.  That\'s a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked Why not I\'ll respond.  Putting aside the application of such a space dock there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control is difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don\'t think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it\'s more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.  Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab Mir Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity even though they had (have) metal skins they still kind of qualify as inflatable.  The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes monotomic Oxygen impingement and radiation effects on materials) so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.  These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success.  -- Ken Jenks NASA/JSC/GM2
' This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable.  For example why does the earth\'s atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is photosynthesis but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material.  On earth this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter mostly from oceanic sources.  However this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).  This suggests that a planet without large oceans or a planet without continents undergoing weathering will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.  There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\'s atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so the oxygen level had dropped too low

This is good when and if we go for Mars (the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the probes.  Also the mother ship would be powered (if not the Mars Mission) by a normal propulsion

' Indeed the sky doesn\'t look much like a black body if you look carefully enough; in particular its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon\'s fat Communications Satellite Handbook has a graph of sky temperature vs. wavelength in fact for communications design.  However in terms of energy content the RF frequencies are negligible. For thermal purposes at very large distances from the Sun the sky looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen Astrophysical Quantities). I haven\'t found a number for non-large distances since solar radiation tends to be something you can\'t just ignore :-)

'Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and relaunching it:  (Caution: speculation mode engaged) There is another consideration that hasn\'t been mentioned yet. I expect that retrieving HST would involve \'damaging\' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and especially the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don\'t \'ring\' due to thermal cycle stresses...)  I also expect that as has been discussed the landing loads on the HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged (I assume that they were caged for launch)?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Corvin \t      \t\t\t\tzwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com GN&C R&D\t\t\t\t\tMartin Marietta Astronautics ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ===============    My views
' Not useful unless you\'ve got some truly wonderful propulsion system for the mother ship that can\'t be applied to the probes.  Otherwise it\'s better to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system and going to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on the way to Neptune.  Don\'t judge interplanetary trajectories in general by what the Voyagers did:  they exploited a lineup that occurs only every couple of centuries and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect route to Neptune.   Solar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system.  They\'re also very slow

'  Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable.  if the shuttle is going to retunr the HST  what bother are some arrays.  just fit them with a quick release.  one  space walk
' If you\'ve got a good propulsion system that\'s not useful for deceleration sure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the deceleration chemically is a major headache.  We\'re talking seriously high cruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto orbit isn\'t easy with chemical fuels.  Incidentally solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration system for something like this.  They don\'t go anywhere quickly.  (I speak as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project
' You don\'t *need* to but it\'s desirable.  HST like all satellites in low Earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason. It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has no propulsion system of its own.)  This is an excellent opportunity

'   I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume that the general public can\'t handle the truth and then based on this  assumption go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone who can understand a good argument comes along and asks why don\'t you just develop the spinoffs? or why can\'t we just get our spinoffs from some other program like the military?  There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects.  I\'m not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.   And if you\'re going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.

'I\'m not sure if this will help you but the (local) interstellar radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups.

'I didn\'t think the bi-stem design was used so much for the retrieval as for the ability to launch in a tight (size) STS envelope.  This is my own  guess based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c  (GRO UARS).  Also there _might_ be some consideration given to mass  requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A).  Finally  the HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember they\'re  going to be replaced with new arrays.  However as an ACS guy who\'s seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over HST I would voice a hearty \'yea\' to using conventional arrays over bi-stems whenever possible.  No half hertz flexible modes no thermal snap
'  If I may offer a constructive criticism perhaps you should decide if you love vehicles or the use they are put to. I myself think the F-86 is a beautiful aircraft but rest assured I wouldn\'t even think of flying it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform.   Not to this degree.   Why?   Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle isn\'t reusable it\'s salvagable).   The flip over happens at a very low speed not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works it will work unless the laws of physics change.   The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example it can loose about 80\% of available thrust and still land safely.   Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that\'s not the same thing. Shuttle simply isn\'t a fault tolerent design SSTO is.   You don\'t put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You wouldn\'t for example give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you?   You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO.   Again refering to the DC-1 it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn\'t. DC is fault tollerent
' That\'s fine idea but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance a power company in Virginia  recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type.  Yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus you couldn\'t even buy a good light from them.  In most places to get a good light you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some point society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.   Companies have to meet pollution standards etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work.  Agreed so I won\'t respond again.  It\'s important for all you spacers out  there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that  have been presented.  Just like Congress

'  This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There was little involvement of federal funds or except through support of state universities of state funds for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads laboratories assistants and equipment and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much but it was provided and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  During WWII the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists\' expertise.  This is probably because of the research mind approach which is not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems the job got done.  The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists and set up other organizations such as  NSF to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also the government did a job on private foundations making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose as has been the case I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is Get the money from NSF.  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is in effect deciding which projects get supported and how much.    Also the government decided that the wealth should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happens the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted I may find  impossible or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday\'s too difficult problem or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast  and except for really vague statements if something can be predicted it is not major research but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it

'  Well there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of. The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity. Likewise after the one-two punch of the Permian and Triassic extinctions the number of marine animals rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread  of humans.  (**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction  (*) about 800 families  Also plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms (pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land.   (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families) (2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families) (3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)  It\'s unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down.  (***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were.   See Cowen\'s book History of Life for a not-too-technical run-down on well like the title sez the history of life. Or see Wilson\'s Diversity of Life for a view centered more on current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology book of (what the hell

Clarke  Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne Florida USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9   This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one human beings wanted to reach them.     Tracing the history of the many imaginative and often prescient attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology science astronomy and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground for that matter.  These also are described in theis book for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era\'s dreams abilities and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500 as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections influences and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss to visualize differences similarities and influences.  This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship.  SPECIAL FEATURES  Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft both real and fictional  Contains scores of illustrations: artwork drawings and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films and unpublished photographs from NASA archives  An index bibliography and appendices are included.

'Wm Hathaway comments;    I agree that the desire for beauty is valid but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky not impeded by the effects of humans but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space a vision that we or at least our descendents may one day be able to see in part because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day I hope humans will be able to look out not upon half the heavens with only nature-creted lights but upon all of the heavens with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it than the \'pristine\' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century) which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don\'t think there\'s any reason to believe that modernity has changed that just because it has changed the way we strive.  BTW there are places that people haven\'t fouled.

'  You should have heard Prof. McNally  from my days as an astronomy undergraduate denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)  However seriously it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights by adding a reflector so that the light only illuminates the ground which is after all where you need it. As a bonus the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least thats what McNally told us all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less as far as I can see )  I suppose that the right to dark skies is no more than an aspiration but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky and are presumably in the area of international law if any

'It is interesting to note in the past few days\' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business.  For many reasons it can and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The \'spaceport political publicity\' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch don\'t think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with the MACDAC folks I get the impression that they want to set a firm believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer and don\'t worry
'  According to this reasoning there are no rights at least none that I can think  of....  Let\'s see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.  Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not by the same reasoning. I could go on with these examples for a long time....  Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority Jews homosexuals blacks and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized  imprisoned and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery?  I guess not because the majority said that slavery was  good for them.  I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law imposed by the majority is immoral one should not follow it.  In fact one should do everything in his/her power to stop it. Of course that doesn\'t mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people  by logic pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life including adequate housing food and medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.  Have you ever been out in the desert away from local lights and most people? The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.  Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never not in your whole life ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you you see squalor and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live for?    I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples but I have seen both. I for one need dreams and hopes and yes beauty

A lot of her philosophy reflects not only a European education but a  reaction against certian events in Russia while she lived there. I\'ve heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy between the Continental and British/American schools Rand belongs in the former in terms of methodology et al even though she was trying to say things that would belong in the latter school.

' Supernovae put out 10^53 or 10^54 (i forget which but it\'s only an order of magnitude...).  Not in gamma rays though.  You\'d hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic  (but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well but I can\'t think of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.  Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That\'s just in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them too

' I too am a Jules Verne collector and can tell you that though tough  to find it *is* out there.  I keep my eyes open all the time for his books at various Bay Area used book stores and every once in a while get *very* lucky.  You just need diligence.  I don\'t know if the book store situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area but good luck. I have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes to SF every other year though the prices are more in the $100-$200 range than the $50 you want to spend.  My guess is that *if* you find it you won\'t need to spend even that much since most people don\'t care  about it.  I think I paid about $15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise good condition copy which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.    Of course if you re willing to buy blind you can put a $2 advertisement in the Antiquarian Bookseller\'s newsletter (the exact title of which escapes me at the moment.)  _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ is not the rarest of Jules Verne books.

'  But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the  resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different beast effectively just 8 coincidence counters one on each corner of  the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to determine parallax.  Indeed parallax would just add a very small  component to the positional error.    Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would  require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort  cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together  now: Parallax ARc SECond a parsec is the distance of an object  that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true we\'re going to  have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.  The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously
'How hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on the way out to the outer planets but once in near to orbit to use more normal means..

'        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this little problem.  I don\'t have a calculator but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago so I\'ll use that and hope it\'s what you wanted.   This is a highly simplified problem with a very simple burst.  Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here.         Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst and the last 4 seconds its flux is half of the peak flux.  It\'s flux is the peak flux the rest of the time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.         Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst for several different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius) R=22.5pc(at the edge of the galaxy) R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a R=8800Mpc.           We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence then used the old standby formula:                         Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak         For a radius of .25 pc we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty energetic for close by.  for the coronal model we found around 10^43 erg/sec. And lastly for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That\'s what you\'d call moderately energetic

'  Of course  \tHow many government projects after Using PERT GANT C.P.M.s Process flow diagrams  Level 5 software projects....  actually come in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined that 80\% of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing to adequately measure  engineering developement costs.     Me I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best  to do research.   I don\'t think the government should pour money into any one sector  but should engage in projects which naturally push the state of the art.    THings like  High tech  construction projects  apollo  was worth it for the doing.  Running hte national labs.  The SSC is grossly overweight  but is a reasonable project at a lower cost.

'  Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this mission?  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence.       Pat this would be slower more expensive and worse.    Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That\'s less than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware retrain and reschedule the EVA\'s in that time.  More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition you\'ve added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.   According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and AXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle
'  I\'m worried by the concern about it though for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds).  (And I\'ve been reading and (and writing) this thread since way back when it was only on sci.space).  For starters I don\'t think the piece of light-pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents or wishful thinking on the part of proponents.  Second this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects that either 1) don\'t increace light pollution significantly or 2) increace light pollution only over the target area.  You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites. I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math showing that SPS\'s weren\'t that bright after all ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.  #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested recently.  While slightly more worrisome I\'d like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned and something any project like that would work against anyway. And given some of the likely targets I don\'t think there\'s going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter and I doubt you\'ll find many activists in Murmansk demanding the natural sky back. If anything he\'ll probably be inside stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp making sure he\'ll get enough vitamin D for the day.

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this was a planned for contingency.  This is not a problem for the shuttle though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site

'Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...       Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time.  A good reference on this might be: Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639). by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically it\'s a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane    The design (the concept is also called Beta) as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10000 pounds into polar orbit or 20000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support.  System design reliability is .9995.    Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage.    To launch the orbital vehicle the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans modified to burn catalyzed JP-7 would shut off and the ramjets would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.    Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\'s success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.      The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost a TSTO is easier cheaper and less risky to develop simpler to build has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn\'t carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel as well as its inherent self- ferry capability it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable.       Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time.  I expect this or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.    Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government\'s future space transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades shuttle replacement (what was called the 4-2-3 architecture) SpaceLifter ELV upgrades and various advanced vehicles (ALES Beta DC-?? NASP FSTS SSTOs of several types etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov\'t space transportation systems and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations) and against the investment and risk of going to leap frog new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.    It\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\'t that there aren\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June
'In some sense I think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful and the folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are both right.  That is I think that space advertising is an interesting idea and if someone wants to try it out more power to them. However a company may discover that the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising

THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to            most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                            This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged            edition of THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE 1959.             Volume I is NOTHING BUT MOTION (1979) and Volume II is            THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER (1988).                            Most books and journal articles on the subject of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial            differentials and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book by            contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.             Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual            validity.                            Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor            of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State            University.  He developed the Theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the            properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements            they contain.                            THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION describes the astrophysical            portions of Larson\'s CONSISTENT INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe a kind of            grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and            astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time:                            (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component MOTION existing in THREE dimensions in DISCRETE            units and with two RECIPROCAL aspects SPACE and TIME.                            (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics its primary magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                            From these two postulates Larson was able to build a            COMPLETE theoretical universe from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the            concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with            translational vibrational rotational and rotational-           vibrational motions.  At each step in the development he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe including            EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example in his 1959            book he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES            several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They            are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And            when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation            ready for those also.                            As a result of his theory which he called THE            RECIPROCAL SYSTEM Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists            including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter            quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure)            nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass            increases relativistic Doppler shifts nuclear fusion in            stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be            nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very            critical of the AD HOC assumptions uncertainty principles            solutions in principle no other way declarations etc.            used to maintain them.                            THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION is divided into 31 chapters.             It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy            formation from the MYTHICAL big bang is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of            SINGLE stars.                            Several chapters are devoted to quasars which according            to Larson are densely-packed clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                            Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            Larson\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an            OPEN MIND.  For example they used to believe that GAMMA RAY            BURSTS originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any            visible objects (except for a few cases of directional            coincidence).  Larson\'s explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER            HALF of the physical universe which Larson calls the cosmic            sector.  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a            RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe with the speed            of light as the BOUNDARY between them and has THREE            dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space the            bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly            at random.                            Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books journal articles and leading physicists and            astronomers.  In this book 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book.  For example a quote from the book            Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey by William K. Hartmann            says Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form.... Unfortunately we cannot.  Larson\'s book contains            LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are            WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists            astronomers and astrophysicists.

'    Henry if I read you correctly you may be asking If I put a blackbody in interstellar space (\'disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects\') what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field?     If that\'s the case let me point out that interstellar dust and  molecules provide many instances of things that are well not-too-far from being blackbodies.  Many different observations including IRAS and COBE have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings Interstellar Processes ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson Jr. published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al. Seab and  Black.     Inside the disk of the galaxy the temperature varies quite a bit from place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association I would guess).  Outside the galaxy of course

Keep that attitude and it\'ll be a couple centuries before we get real access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes along and kicks our ass in the space race.   Or NASA HQ.

You can get hypersonic flight data with an X-15 or a follow-on X-15 type vehicle for much less.  And economics and engineering are interchangable; engineering in the absense of economics is basically just physics and in terms of physics the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X-15.

To the accuracy it can be calculated (see specific references in Allen about how it is calculated) the temperature is 3 degrees K.       Lots of people have remarked on this temperature.  The first may have been in Eddington\'s book Internal Constitution of Stars Ch. 13 (1926; reprinted 1986) where he gives the temperature of space as 3 degrees.       The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight.        To the accuracy of measurement

Modern  ground-based visible light astronomy (what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or space-based telescopes. In any case a bright point of light passing through the field doesn\'t ruin observations. If that were the case the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned

'        Batse alone isn\'t always used to determine position.  WHen a particularly bright burst occurs There are a couple of other detectors that catch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I\'m getting at here.  This puppy is far enough away that if a bright burst happens nearby the huge annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given by BATSE and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh 2 or 3 degrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.

'In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review section there was a report of a group called Space Marketing in Atlanta Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising. There was an editorial about this in the Times the following Tuesday.  Are others as upset about this as I am?

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental aspects of their advertising.  Fred\'s argument is roughly akin to saying that it\'s bad to cut down trees so we shouldn\'t advertise in newspapers.  Think that through Fred.  Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure filled with bio-degradable foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space debris as it orbits thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large drag coefficient it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a year.  Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle which does not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science experiments proposed and built by high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs.  Advertisers buy time on the billboard whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages to every country.  During orbital night the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all to see.  -- Ken Jenks NASA/JSC/GM2
'   We don\'t disagree on this.  All I said was that a right is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn\'t come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  Common law rights are vague and situational; that\'s why the people insisted on a Bill of Rights in the Constitution spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate power is power.  That\'s why the federal government can force states to grant their citizens rights they don\'t wish to: In a slugging match the feds win.  Period.

'[ stuff deleted ]  The French SPOT is an example that comes to mind.  Although the company (name escapes me at the moment) sells images world-wide you can bet your last dollar (franc??) that the French gov\'t gets first dibs.  I remember a few years ago (about the time SPOT was launched) I was speaking to my Dad (an USAF officer) about this and that and I happend to mention SPOT (I think we were talking about technology utilization).  He just about went ballistic.  He wanted to know how I knew about SPOT and just what I knew.  I guess that space surveillance is such a sensitive topic in the Air Force that he couldn\'t believe that I would read about such a system in the popular press (ie. AV week).  mark
'Yesterday I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down) they made a big presentation on the 777 and other programs.  This year it was much more bare-bones.  In any case I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear and so I got there early and figured that If I didn\'t get to the mike maybe they would read mine off of a card and so I wrote it down and handed it in.  After the meeting started Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs.  Naturally I was crushed.  So when question and answer time came I was suprised to find my question being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early and getting the question in early made all the difference.  So on to the substance. The question was   Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport such as a commercial space launch system and if not how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass?  Well he read it without a hitch and without editing with impressed me then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question last part first.  This is to the best of my recollection what he said.  As far as single stage to orbit technology we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach and we are talking to some of our customers  about that.  As far as commercialization that is a long ways off.  The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point.  So this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena and for the most part this is true however it also tells me that  they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own.  Now I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually this is a mis-nomer as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing however he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts.  He won\'t tell me what he is doing but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind
'I didn\'t want to quote all the stuff that\'s been said recently I just wanted to add a point.     The whole question of a right to a dark sky revolves around the definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and good but as far as I can see a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations the government or the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are and then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S. the constitution provides a Bill of Rights from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive.  I\'m sure that most other countries have comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the U.S.) you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague

' Back in January and February there were several articles (Wash Post Time...) saying that NASA was considering the option just as it is now considering a followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission.

It works  realtime not after the fact as is the case with Hubble.  You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the  April 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product. It lists for $1290.  The article states: The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System  comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry  around.  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope\'s focal plane.  Now just imagine how well this infant  technology will do in a few years especially in a dedicated system that  has hundreds of thousands of dollars
'A young French skeptic who reads (skeptically) the UFO review OVNI Presence (O.P.) sent me the following excerpt from an August 92 issue of this review (R.G. = Robert Galley French minister of defense in 1974 answering about the Belgian UFO wave):  O.P. : Can you conceive that the U.S. could allow themselves to send  their most modern crafts over foreign territory with the Belgian  hierarchy ignoring that ? R.G. : Absolutely ! The best proof which I can give is that some time  ago without informing the French authorities the U.S. based in  Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte (*). We followed  this plane and after its landing on the Ramstein airport Colonel X  got back the shots of Pierrelatte. The U.S. had not informed us...

' Ahh perhaps that\'s why we\'ve (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones. Seriously though you\'re never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway.  Also scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things continuously for ~45 minutes at a time which can be a serious limitation.   I sure as hell does if the \'point of light\' is half a degree in extent and as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the night sky is on a moonlit night?

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection.

'        _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely       no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have       to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to       conventional Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching       by comets it\'s got too many holes in it to count but at       least it was a good try...     So you have a plausible model for GRB\'s at astronomical distances?  I don\'t have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)     Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star    hypothesis which had a lot of problems anyhow.  We have to look for    implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of    models.  Hmm the superbowl burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis from what I\'ve read (and I haven\'t seen the papers only the press) I\'d say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models     A paper on the possibility of GRB\'s in the Oort cloud just came    through the astrophysics abstract service.

'   You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network. Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged one can often get positions down to ~arc minutes.  BTW about Oort cloud sources: shouldn\'t this be testable in the fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1 ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU this is on the order of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably

For example is : >there a constant sensation of falling?   Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied: : Yes weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first : but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that : of sky diving.  I\'m no astronaut but I\'ve flown in the KC-135 several times.  I\'ll tell you about my first flight.  At the on-set of weightlessness my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened.  I felt a momentary panic and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold).  At that point I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the return of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out so I didn\'t really pay attention to physiology at that time.  After about 5 parabolas I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I\'ve discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms which needed to be in rapid concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to parabola 5 my queasiness finally started to get to me and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically useless for the rest of that flight so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider one of those anomalous people who don\'t get sick on the thing.)  I didn\'t think of it as a constant sensation of falling so much as like swimming in air.  It\'s very close to the sensations I feel when I\'m scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.  Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?   Ron: : It is the body\'s reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be : induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. : Some people are more prone to it than others like some people are more : prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.

I\'m a volunteer in JSC\'s Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do among other things some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer which consisted of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual aids.  The goal was to measure the victim\'s^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject\'s responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness symptoms.

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME\'s you don\'t have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burn(s).  On-orbit SSME\'s are just dead weight since we don\'t have an SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means that you can\'t use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has a couple of advantages but more disadvantages.  Throw-away SSME\'s might let us use some of the old SSME\'s which are not- quite-man-ratable.

' No if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field it produces a voltage. The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or move the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth\'s magnetic field isn\'t really significant especially when you consider how weak the Earth\'s magnetic field is to begin with.   Well it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth\'s magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course this force only works in one direction and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3 and the earth\'s magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic construction. And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers perhaps).  And the physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our blood among other things).  In other words forget it.   I missed out on the dragless satellite thread but it sounds totally bogus
' Well it\'s not that simple -- you\'re in Earth\'s magnetic field and you don\'t generate electricity -- but it can be done.   The way you power things is with electricity so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say propel rather than power the answer is sort of.)  Yes you can use interaction with the Earth\'s magnetic field to get electrical power and there are potential applications for this.  However bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn\'t coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations however.  What you *can* do is get your power by some other means e.g. solar arrays and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.  If you want more information trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion tether applications and magsails.   No.  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag

On April 22 and 23 delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43 (Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas) respectively.  Initial results  indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.  2.  On April 23 a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received properly.  3.  On April 23 the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).  4.  On April 26 cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) Dust Detector (DDS) and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27 a navigation cycle was performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63 DSS-14 and DSS-43.  6.  On April 26 real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28. The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.       After verifying proper RRA slewing the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence.  7.  On April 27 a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase.  8.  On April 28 the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees back to 25 degrees then to 51 degrees back to 22 degrees then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29 1993 is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS            EUV UVS EPD MAG HIC and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 203 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took place April 27 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1 1993 with DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).  2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday April 29.   A review of current Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules past months accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday April 29 1993 the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  \tDistance from Earth         187745300 km (1.26 AU) \tDistance from Sun           296335800 km (1.98 AU) \tHeliocentric Speed          89100 km per hour \tDistance from Jupiter       522015800 km \tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes
'       Well almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can  engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order  harmonics of the Earth\'s gravitational field can pump energy into a  satellite and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of  months to years.        My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT  satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class which are in 14:1 resonance. In  particular C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in  altitude the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude  of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18  March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the  limitations of NORAD\'s software -- but that\'s another story.)       This probably has little relevance to space stations since the 71  degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km which is  unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But  it\'s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the  situation.       (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

'  Obviously not.  Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible.  The CGRO is what 10 meters long?  You\'d need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.  What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector

' If you\'re doing large-scale satellite servicing being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justifying development of such a thing.   You\'d almost certa
