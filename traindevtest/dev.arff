Allow me one last inter- jection then please:  Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you\'ve excepted the Messianic for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it\'s these religious  Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy,  rather than by faith, who won\'t agree?  Orthodox Jews?    As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains  unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often  look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree. For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I\'m not so  sure the atheists can be counted out.   For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham, or David in accepting God\'s Word? Is the particular covenant to which one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might  understand why I think it\'s premature to assert who will and won\'t agree.',3

183,'    The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what\'s inside and some indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound engineering community.)  The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain.   They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.  I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to make this happen.

668,'  Well, I\'ve provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  I don\'t think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  I\'ll have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I don\'t claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn\'t harmful, although it isn\'t helpful either (to the mating process).

260,'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\'d do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default 2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...',1

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger    in and of it self did not uncover flaws.  2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is    not dependent on sophisticated tools  (CASE tools?).  However, tools    cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle    Language) is somewhat limited.  3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated Level 5 by a NASA team.    This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.  4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info    on our software development process.

685,' It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn\'t be pushed any further.  I\'d say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn\'t last too long, and doesn\'t seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus\'s at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren\'t what they need, I\'m sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don\'t get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can\'t design systems that meet just their needs, or we won\'t sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don\'t have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don\'t expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That\'s a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available, yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!   I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an effect (not immediate, I\'m sure, but complaints aren\'t going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we  hear similar things from more than one person/site).  All of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI\'s.',1

394,'The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....  Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by NASA headquarters.  The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called Bus-1 spacecraft, the orbiter and Spacelab.  The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data Management System.  Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.  Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab.  Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and propulsion systems.  The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.  Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C, the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation.  The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 decks connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  This can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.  Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the Soyuz TM spacecraft.  The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5.  Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  What\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to be held May 3.  Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.  Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being carried on the schedule are:  April 26 Design Freeze on Options for Costing  April 27 Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT  May 3 Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee  May 15 Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee  June 7 Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee ',2

1407,' Actually, Hiten wasn\'t originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didn\'t have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn\'t be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you\'d need for the brute-force approach.',2

463,'THE DIVINE MASTERS                              Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that            Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God            into the physical world, God Incarnate.                            But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of ETERNAL DAMNATION in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional feelings are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM or SOUND            CURRENT, (referred to as THE WORD in John 1:1-5, and as            The River of Life in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            silver cord.                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul\'s cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the SOUL PLANE, which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living Eck Master or Mahanta for the            Eckankar organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the Sant            Mat organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS, by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the Anti-Christ, which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called last days.  But the Masters            don\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book HERE AND HEREAFTER, by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50\% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the KING JAMES VERSION.  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person\'s PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               2nd COMINGS                 If a Divine Master physically dies (translates)            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (translates), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus\' 2nd Coming are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called Hades, and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian Heaven is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the SOUND            CURRENT (THE WORD, THE BANI, THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The SOUND CURRENT manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as SOUL TRAVEL)            REPLACE blind faith.

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into a reality in their own lives.  Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand - join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe. Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying the message of brotherhood to all humankind.  Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.   \t\t    ----  Making History  ----  The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break- throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian- Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace; and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.   \t\t ----  Speaking as One: World  ----              ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----  The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over - Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and entertainment personalities.  Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including specials on PBS, MTV and NBC\'s Today Show.  reconciliation.

There, runners from around the world were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.  From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa.

Each year the Team puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.  The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace, offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.  The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit organization based in the United States.                  ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----  The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a million participants. We\'re expecting even more people to join Peace Run \'93.  You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps, a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the runners as they carry the Torch through your community.  You can also join local celebrities and government officials in one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the 70-nation route.  Your inner support is important too. If you\'re a runner, each time you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.   \t\t ----  The Next Step is Yours  ---- \t\t ----  Make It One For Peace  ----   For information contact: Peace Runs International 161-44 Normal Road Jamaica, NY 11432 USA tel. 718/291-6637  Fax: 718/291-6978  Peace Run Canada 2456 Agricola Street Halifax, Nova Scotia  B3K 4C2 tel. 902/425-1174  Fax: 902/420-0773',3

46,'     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in The Australian Muslim Times, the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don\'t deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim.  In general, anyone who calls themselves a Muslim and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term Muslim is to be contrasted with Mu\'min, which means true believer.  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a true believer or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say Muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu\'min, or true believer in Islam.',0
1653,' <Moral Driver distinctions deleted>   Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge and an object. The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven\'t attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don\'t think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen \'amplitudes\', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can\'t define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\'s Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?. I think I need some more time with this one.  That\'s about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:',3

666,'A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland     on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near     Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part     was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They     were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became     enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle     of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby     forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were     visible till morning sunrise.      The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in     Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in     the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was     only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.     A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a     spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about     five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the     upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of     the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright     spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails     were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still     visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.      The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don\'t know if     there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near     Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too.

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the fact that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as Shape Shifter than Space Lifter.  We didn\'t spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s and 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]',2

1002,'    The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke\'s text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what\'s that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies. Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.     In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.',0

The Flat-Earthers state that the Earth is flat is a fact. I don\'t accept this, I think it\'s an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are right because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.  Although I can\'t prove that a god doesn\'t exist, the arguments used to support a god\'s existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and I\'m not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that I absolutely can\'t ignore.  A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken, in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he wrote something like Can you prove it isn\'t so? I certainly can\'t, but I\'m not going to believe him, because he based his proof on some really questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it circumstancial evidence :] ).

1379,'    I\'m sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word create is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.     I should have said given the Mormon belief.  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.     Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.     It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being offspring of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually born again of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it\'s why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   <...>     On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply look at the Bible to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?     Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie\'s belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)     On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie\'s words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.',3

1924,' Yep, that\'s pretty much it. I\'m not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don\'t really know what the created in His image means. I\'ve heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ\'s example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only know Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is wrong. Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The wrongness here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.  David.  --- On religion:',3

828,'Okay, I\'ll bite. I should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...   But didn\'t he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.   Well, I\'m no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the long knives. The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\'s SA circle.   Well, you\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\'t believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the knight of the long knives several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\'s homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\'ve  read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.    I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\'t you think they  would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving), then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?  I don\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\'s friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a  product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\'s homosexuality.  In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis,  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality. Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.  No, I don\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access  to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I don\'t have the time. Nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.',3
127,'-*----  The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural assumptions that are independent of these rules.    The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility. Indeed, many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility. Once again, we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.    And who is to say that this interpretation is twisted?  There are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way. Michael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments to show that such readings are twisted, because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians, Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions that these conservative Christians will reject.     But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems. The meaning of these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition, or from some combination of these things.  These commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments.    Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many* parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are straightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline epistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior, the problem is *not* a lack of raw material.   -*----  No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel  seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel.   In a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve as the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the nature of the Christian god and about what men should and shouldn\'t do.   The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extra-Christian principles through which Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply the *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to their cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that make Michael\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by Christian interpretation.    Michael paints a picture of standard American atheism as the rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian interpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and the nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I think we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the lukewarm we should spit out. ',3

416,'   Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace. The problem that I\'ve run into though, is that when it creates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary. If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially printing.  Chuck',1
1248,' The idea of an apostacy did not originate with Lucy Smith or Joseph Smith or the Mormons.  The idea of a restoration was quite common in the early 19th century USA.  Alexander Campbell, founder of the group that now survives with the name Disciples of Christ preached that the primitive church had been lost and was attempting to restore it (although not be revelations).  Many Cambellites subsequently became Mormons, including co-founder Sidney Rigdon.

1162,' [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to \'or\' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print. Who\'d have guessed?',1
1161,'  Diplomatic :-)  I realize I\'m fighting Occam\'s razor in this argument, so I\'ll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, I\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\'re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, \'obfuscate\' the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isn\'t used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but (again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \'if you see object X, then perform action Y,\' and we don\'t seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what conclusions to draw from it\'s experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also, neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\'s code?  The next problem is the sticky question of What is colour? (replace \'colour\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the materialist viewpoint is that it\'s the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a computer won\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn\'t? It shouldn\'t, because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?    A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called \'Unitary Evolution\' (or \'U\'), is governed by Schroedinger\'s equation and is well known. The second process, called various things such as \'collapse of the wavefunction\' or \'state vector reduction\' (or \'R\'), and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a \'measurement\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \'something else,\' which I shall imaginitively call \'part X.\' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the wavefunction. Note, though, that we\'d need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway, I\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear superpositions of anything, although there are alternative explainations for this. I\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X, but since this is only speculation, that won\'t matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.  I\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\'s OK with you :-)   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Kevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk             Don\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.',0

1077,' Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person\'s self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mental/verbal level, and don\'t usually find expression in society except in an impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.   Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue...    Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it doesn\'t hurt others?  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it is not a morality in that it doesn\'t propound any specifically preferred behaviours.   I\'ll add a hearty me two.  However, one could just as well say just because certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn\'t really get an impression of which one is truly right.     best regards,',0

555,' OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\'85-\'89), the PI (\'88-\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\'s - \'86-\'90), the Power Series parallel systems (\'88-\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don\'t, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\'t wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If that\'s happening, it\'s becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don\'t give up, we know it.  Josh   |:-)  --  ',1

Socrates said : there were many gods; if that is true then your monotheism (and our : atheism) is mistaken, even if Socrates never existed.   Jim,  I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt\'s questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of atheism.',0
228,'  Well, no, during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was not opened until after the Shuttle had landed.    I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter with the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination worries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to  keep clean.  But I still don\'t know where the idea is coming from that HST _NEEDS_ a re-boost.  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them.  There is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in December.',2

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used    for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for double size scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\'m not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.  Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...  -Peter Lee   ',1

42,'My turn to jump in! :)   I think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics. Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people\'s life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don\'t deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.     WELCOME TO OZLAND!!!!!!! :)  What is NOT arbitrary?  If you can find some part of society, some societal rules, morals, etc. that are not arbitrary, please tell me.  I don\'t think there are any.  Sounds like euphemisms to me.  The difference seems to be, that objective is some reasoning that I like, while arbitrary is some reasoning that I don\'t like OR don\'t understand. ',0

627,' Superficially a good answer, but it isn\'t that simple.  An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\'ve got.  Perhaps it\'s more accurate to say that there\'s a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed Pro-Life movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don\'t believe this to be the case. ',3
24,'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.  \tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively \tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume \tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not \texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable \tmeasure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment \tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two \ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw \tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is \talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge \tcolored with a special edge color  \tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.

151,'Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:   (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize precisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it\'s a compressed format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header.   (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be really nice to find some sort of hrftopbm converter out there. ;)',1

450,'    I would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did  definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it was Descartes who said that All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.  If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that\'s simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher.  Regarding Nietzsche, he\'s one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now.  They\'ll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.  As for modern philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and  amplified them over time).  I would say that the most influential american philosopher would have to be Dewey.  But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was American, but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.',2

1154,'  Isn\'t that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors, specifically the Patriarch Abraham (zl).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave gifts (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.  So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture, your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn\'t stop us from respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We\'re content to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.  But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that. Too bad.  Is this typical of your religion?   You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the typical New Ager doesn\'t acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite, self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews, and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your words are simple slander.   Of course, from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  We\'d say that there is no godhead -- just created beings who may be enjoying a good laugh at your expense.   So not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  And you expect any of us to pay attention to you and your religion?  Why not call us more name?   Maybe then we\'ll all convert in gratefullness!   You delude yourself. ',3

1538,'I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted. I\'ve been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar\'s article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed, with the disclaimer (fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and false statements]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the ISLAM: a clearer view thread as well as the root of the Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW] thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven\'t read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn\'t in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the a clearer view posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you\'ll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims.  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie\'s essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course, you are more than welcome to do so.',0

I think Robert Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.  Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman, a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh), and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as quite a few references.   Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary Society*:  V36 p. 201-209 (1983) V36 p. 483-489 (1983) V37 p. 135-141 (1984) V37 p. 491-494 (1984) V38 p. 113-119 (1984) V38 p. 133-136 (1984)  (Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of reprints?

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book\'s sale to help restore the telescope. Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by mail order.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify archie as the host name and archie as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying I can\'t FTP, could someone mail this to me?  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm, and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie\'s help. Don\'t overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC\'s FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word \'help\'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL\'s postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

1258,' Well, it\'s not that simple -- you\'re in Earth\'s magnetic field, and you don\'t generate electricity -- but it can be done.   The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say propel rather than power, the answer is sort of.)  Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth\'s magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this.  However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn\'t coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however.  What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.  If you want more information, trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion, tether applications, and magsails.   No.  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around dragless.',2

1860,'In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a \'foamed aluminum\' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder ',2

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner.  ',0
171,'The primary problem in human nature is a fragmentation of being. Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\'s rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called theosis, or deification.  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.',3

769,'I\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It\'s not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don\'t think I\'ll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example everybody can sell you everything.   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50\% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don\'t worry  because we\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won\'t worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25\% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. ',2

1272,'       Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can  engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order  harmonics of the Earth\'s gravitational field can pump energy into a  satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of  months to years.        My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT  satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In  particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in  altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude  of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18  March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the  limitations of NORAD\'s software -- but that\'s another story.)       This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71  degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is  unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But  it\'s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the  situation.       (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

33,'Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...  I\'m the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

1882,' I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK\'s R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I\'ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :   \t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail \t\t\t-------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a \'conventional\' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

1403,'                  God being unknowable, I can\'t comment on His motives, but it would be distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of  our own.  For sanity\'s sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes  through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex  canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another,  or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God\'s message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility  for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that  God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source  for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.        Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness.  You might have said burp, for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about taking the Lord\'s  name in vain as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of  hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.   If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for example, God\'s code could include, Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on, but this law would be inapplicable to us. Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God.   But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God\'s moral code, you have a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category morality can be sensibly applied.',3

As published in US Industrial Outlook 1993  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15\%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  Space Business Indicators in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10\% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 \% per year  through the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request launch on demand  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/Spacelifter program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all ELV upgrade programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed Spacelifter  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC GO-AHEAD    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a Star Wars spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95\%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25\% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 \% over today\'s average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the Aerokosmos  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the Severkosmos,  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  \'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as the main  alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10\% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10\% of the  satellite\'s communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is Asiasat- 2, but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based Asiasat program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s  aerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely made in Korea.   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+\%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.

1470,'   Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is probably the weakest evidence.    What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).',3

I haven\'t found the perfect graphics program that does everything yet.    My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different formats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.  One of my major problems is that there isn\'t any programs available on the market for the artistically deprived :-).  ',1
1448,'SSRT ROLLOUT                  Speech Delivered by Col. Simon P. Worden,                      The Deputy for Technology, SDIO                                                        Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach                               April 3,1993       Most of you, as am I, are children of the 1960\'s.  We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - you\'ve lost it!  The me generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle - to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened to your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more before putting the first rubber on the road.  Max Hunter - you didn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn V\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!',2
1676,'From the article What\'s New Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:  ........ WHAT\'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published The Man Who Sold the Moon, which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold\'s latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really, really depressed.               Enzo',2

1697,'Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a good thing by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called The Gay Agenda and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don\'t understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN EX-GAY SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\'s homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians a way out of the homosexual death-style through prayer.  I\'d like to give the award back, Caligiuri now laughs, I\'m no longer deserve it.   Caligiuri\'s eight year involvement with the national ex-gay movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  There\'s no reality in it, he says, I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality, explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that about 80\% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.   Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time, says Lisa Seeley, a former redeemed lesbian who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.   It\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior, says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. But it\'s really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  I was really drunk, he recalls, and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  He had another man there with him, Caligiuri recalls.  I thought at this time, \'If this is what being gay is about, I don\'t want to be this way anymore.   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\'s gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services, Caligiuri says, so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we\'d preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, They\'ll do anything to reach these people.   David used to go on radio and say really stupid things, recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.   Caligiuri\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  They were relieved, he recalls. They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a \'reformed\' gay person.   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  By the time I appeared on Sally\'s show, I\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.  When he wasn\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other reformed homosexuals.   I didn\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another, Caligiuri says.  We\'d go to conferences in other cities, and we\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.   By the time he appeared on \'AM Philadelphia\' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\'s host asked him if he ever acted on temptation, his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri\'s duplicity began to take it\'s toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  I was too sick to go to church, he explains.  The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry\'s doors.  I\'d convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people, he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (I\'m interest- ed in belief systems that aren\'t judgemental.), considering romance (But not with a CHristian!), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes, he says.  I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.  ---end article---  Caligiuri\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of \'ex-gay\' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian Lazarus Project of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as Love In Action and others, who either once claimed to have been reformed or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sin through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for \'suicide\' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\'s _Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\'s _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.',3
1177,'In <1993Apr24.214843.10940@midway.uchicago.edu> eeb1@quads.uchicago.edu   I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause me to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a moment of silence is that it is NOT an even-handed way of allowing for religion amongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this.  There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this moment of silence shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer  being able taking note of it.)  A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant mainstream religion.  All that a moment of silence does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn\'t NEED it, to have a special place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the moment of silence it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.  Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians.  As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this moment of silence campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it\'s worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in making their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so.  If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you.  Give it up.',3
763,' Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using petty sarcasm.  So B.M. can have his temporary atheists whenever he needs them and all the temporary atheists can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam.  ',0

922,' \tI am puzzled by the term concept. Drag free may already have been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth\'s gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag. ',2
172,'-*----  Far from being tossed out, the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus. I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who tosses out the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly.  Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader.  There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as historically valid or tosses out the text.  I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice.  Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as telling the gospel truth about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite author\'s history of whatever.)  Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence?  The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the  vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The modern American history textbooks that whitewash great American figures are historical evidence.  These are all historical evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that great American figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. They are better evidence that some people saw the Maharishi, late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe saw vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history.  How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\'s Historian\'s Fallacies as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history.  It\'s relatively cheap.  It\'s easy to read.  Give it a try.',3

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high  refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.   The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local  bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).         With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers  maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate  of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768  non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater  than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video  standards.         WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology,  which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more  comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility  developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen  and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.

1329,'Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\'an. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon God and His Messenger the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\'s case.  There is a distinction in the Qur\'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation,  the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many Muslims, and Rushdie\'s (and his publishers) Media games.     I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Qur\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Qur\'an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple this or that process. There may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\'an. The Qur\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:  ...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances  of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the Qur\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\'an.....  Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\'anic verses (Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them, so that they may beware. (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. I\'ve listed a few major  divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\'an, Sunnah, Consensus, Reasoning)  The study of Qur\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world. The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves? He (S.A.) replied: By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for your religion and shun them. I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as The fortress of Islam. My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Qur\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him.   I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST\'s orbit.  I think right now  it\'s sitting  at 180 miles up, they would like  220.  I don\'t know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.   Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It\'s mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.  THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn\'t light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it\'s own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.    From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can\'t even carry extra Suits or MMU\'s.  Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth\'s ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways, said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite, he continued.  The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements, Margitan explained, and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\'s Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        ',2

1661,'[Please, note the Newsgroups.]  Recent discussion about XV\'s problems were held in some newsgroup. Here is some text users of XV might find interesting. I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even you so my articles a while ago.  I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fine program XV is that it is worth of improving. (I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)  Any misundertanding of mine is understandable.   Juhana Kouhia   ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  Note that \'xv\' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also, there\'s three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too.   This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.   IMHO, it is design error of \'xv\'; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. There\'s two errors:   -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of    original 24bit should be a special case   -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer    -- the main case should be that \'xv\' quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases    in saving the image, if at all)   ==clip==  ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design. It is error in design. It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that.  As matter of fact, I\'m sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. That were not done and now we have  -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)  -the program has human interface errors.  Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.  [ ..deleted.. ]  ==clip==  Some new items follows.  ==clip==  I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant.  If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.  I don\'t know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no. So, use of XV\'s -best24 option is not very good idea.  I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- I\'m sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I can say nothing about it.)  ==clip==  ==clip==  Some minor bugs in human interface are:  Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.  Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is completed. Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when I\'m writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.  In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first and then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet. I suggest of adding an \'apply\' button to update the exchanges done.',1

1444,' Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a small fishing village by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had opulent and flourishing bazaars and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware. During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel\'s withdrawel in 1984, Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a major city)?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.   A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don\'t doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don\'t most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don\'t seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven\'t seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.

Everything you\'ve said so far could apply equally to any religion -- why do you believe yours is the real one?

246,' I agree, which is why I\'ve asked for help with it.  The reason I\'m working on this list is because I\'ve recently had one too many Christians tell me the Bible contains no contradictions whatsoever.  They believe that it\'s true, and that it describes reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.  Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these people, I\'ve got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with this list.  Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat denials.  I\'ve never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are indeed two different accounts of creation. ',3

779,' It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now, there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (x,y)\'s).  2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you        can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the        Reference(x,y).      b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where correct is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and you can\'t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.

387,'    Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)       Sean, I don\'t want to get into a \'mini-war\' by what I am going to say, but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris, you\'ll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve those for c.s.m.a :-) )     I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn\'t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don\'t know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn\'t even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMind\'s Accelerator?)?     Don\'t misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.     But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in  my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

1855,' [...]  Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we invaded Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where we cross someone\'s border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation invades the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).  [...]  No, it\'s someone who believes in peace-at-all-costs.  In other words, a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political  dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.  Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik, you ask?  Well, it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if you\'d rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant\'s heel, then yes, it\'s bad to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be bad and unconscionable.  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with  the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and  many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)  All to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up  and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do so requires a strong national defense.

Larson\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the Reciprocal System, is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.                      (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL            DATUM).                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                           The following is a complete list of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson\'s books about his comprehensive GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.

Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesn\'t have each of them.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson\'s Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal RECIPROCITY.                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\'s lack of a fancy PH.D. degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a unified field theory that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that epicycles, crystal spheres,            geocentricity, flat earth theory, etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\'s Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson\'s organization, THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE, and Editor of            their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY.  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   Super Collider BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super            Collider, in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific            value.                      Most physicists don\'t realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (mesons, hyperons, ALLEGED quarks, etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the Supercollider?!                                 Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum.                       In Larson\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove Einstein\'s General Theory of Relativity.                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than General Relativity can, by            INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity.  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of Special            Relativity, including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing            about this.]                            In regard to mass increases, it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\'s Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called Big Bang (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION, by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the 3-degree background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\'s success:            In his first book in 1959, THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE, Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the Cosmic Sector.  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by fusion.  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter, neutron            stars, black holes, etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode\'s Law.                         Black Hole FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black            holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole, and            concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original black holes.                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black            holes, etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, it is            clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser.  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\'s            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER, by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\'s book NOTHING BUT            MOTION] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.                            Note that in Larson\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the unit frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the unit rate).             (Unit velocity is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson\'s Theory.)  [I might have the above and            below labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\'s Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the unit frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            science (or physics, or astronomy, etc.), as well as            the scientific literature and the education systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

By     the time they could make the Earth\'s sky look like Las Vegas,     the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round    trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as    5000 kg in a Low Earth advertising orbit: Very roughly the    same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were    to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...  This is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercials on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own hour long nationally broadcast TV program.     There\'s always been a problem of having to get     away from civilization before you can really find natural    scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn\'t take a trip    of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles    or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards    on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still    wild. While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital    billboards aren\'t the problem: They are just a symptom of     growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will    not save your view of the night sky, because by the time     such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble    finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_    the stars...

585,'I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.  In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent ex-gay ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as ineffective . . . not one person was healed.  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed reparative therapy.  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called The Ex-Ex-Gay by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is physically forced to stay in this reparative therapy but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\';t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some first-hand real life and loving understanding.  God\'s love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant.',3
1916,'   I think that you are changing the meaning of values here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word value above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as objective values.  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word values is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will be a good beginning. ',3
1357,'    It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille\'s translations (in his book, The Bible, the Qur\'an and Science) for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   ...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.  (Also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator\'s interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You\'re right, what the verses _do_ contain isn\'t all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that\'s how he\'s a Dr.) thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur\'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)',0

Remember that not every nation follows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of history, it was probably true that the rulers `owned\' everything not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America, where by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn\'t noticed, there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what. Of course, if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it would hardly be non-coercive.  Some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space and also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example) to discourage them.

This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from off the shelf technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:  1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?  2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies?  3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit?  4.

Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW),  who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest  character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah\'s blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts.

757,'From another space forum     When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56  solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers  lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,      It\'s been a long time since something like this happened.  We\'ve  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker\'s supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its extra payload.  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.      A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that  the Shuttle processor will take appropriate action.

835,' First and foremost, I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago.  I know your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did, but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.

I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a \'cultural virus\' that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from there.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many other people believe in it, it must be right, no?  I don\'t believe in any life after death.  I believe that when I die, I die, so therefore it\'s up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime.  I don\'t believe that it\'s a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a constructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the \'faults\' of these opinions to me.  I don\'t believe in \'loving everyone\', especially people I\'ve never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my love and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it.  If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop trying to show me how the Bible makes sense.  Start trying to show me that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone\'s life here on Earth. ',3

637,'    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here\'s a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called PEX.  PEXlib is a slightly lower level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of policy - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you\'re working strictly in X and don\'t care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API\'s have a lot in common.',1
106,' Could it be Public Missile, Inc in Michigan?  From the description of ad here, it sounds like they\'re talking about High Power Rocketry, an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this blanket waiver. There is also a High Power Safety Code which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and safe flight at a total impulse level.  For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup.',2

Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..

683,'frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\'Dwyer) writes ...  While I\'ll agree that these are generally held to be good things, I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally good or bad.  And when I referred to the truth I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one\'s morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one\'s own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. ',0

573,'------- Blind-Carbon-Copy  To: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.org Subject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperation Date: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDT From: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>  4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE  NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give full consideration to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.',2
21,'  Fine. I\'ll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!!  That assumes I can\'t weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a break on the launcher, I\'ll cut you in on the proceeds if it works).  Only the government pays higher-than-list price.    Unless you\'re Martin Marietta, since (as I recall) they bought out the GD line of aerospace products.   If MM/GD does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better than buying at list price.  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built in to the Titan?  C\'mon. Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this or that...    Oh please.  How much of a profit do you want?  Pulling $100-150 million after all is said and done wouldn\'t be too shabby.

Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I\'ve never    heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?

Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will    take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project    management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail, and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is    consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a    rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,    and typically a `software engineering process group\' within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts    are effective and certified.',2

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\'ll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\'ll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it\'s stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you\'ve got the gumption... that\'s what they\'re here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.      \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site \t\t \tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite  \t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely anonymous FTP to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don\'t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you\'re in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... \tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines \tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\'ll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we\'ll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5 disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\'d just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you\'d send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this info-file there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the .rm file for     the image or series of images...or in the Artists directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn\'t explicitly given, then you\'ll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\'ll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it\'s always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in dos format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit code for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:   \tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you\'d like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That\'s about it for now.  More guidelines will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS    \t     (a sumerian deity) or it\'s followers, be they pope, priest, \t     or ezine administrator.

The files will go to the public at large.   \t     It\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone \t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.       \t     Unless you\'ve given permission for that, it\'s illegal.  OTIS \t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights \t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to  \t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed  \t     electronically.  If you don\'t want your images distributed      \t     all-over, don\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is \t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or \t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not  \t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,         \t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific \t     permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is stimulate.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\'s ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

681,' Rome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle, and she said Worship Cybele and you\'ll be saved. They did, they were.  Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son & lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian, from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.  It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater), could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black, prob. IS connected to that Ka\'aba they\'ve got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women. They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.  Wow.

Since the advertising is just to help defray costs, it\'s certainly no surprise that the taxpayers would bear most of the expense.  Sounds like a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the expense if they didn\'t do the advertising.   Great idea, they should have done it long ago.   I can\'t believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day, but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it\'s in LEO, so it would only be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time as it goes zipping across the sky.   No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so it would be no surprise.   Well, look on the, er, bright side.

The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.   Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million).

167,'Jesus:     Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an easy and as straight forward as it reads.  Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you. And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone. Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with  whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.    Jesus uses the word men.  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out. Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian  is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian  can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven\'t seen Jesus\'s light, your evil deeds simply haven\'t been exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn\'t even know existed.   So do you see Jesus\'s point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus\'s perspective.  Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth, which do you choose?   And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light,  who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death.   And Kent, don\'t you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him. David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn\'t even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.  Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David Koresh wasn\'t anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago.    So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your mother\'s name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start.  The wouldn\'t have followed Koresh. They wouldn\'t have died.  But look what happened.  Their ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot.  Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?   Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded,  was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus\'s case, Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It didn\'t work with Jesus.    Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate? Who was Koresh\'s teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None  of them had an excuse.  ',3

798,'RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992  \t\tWHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE  I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC  \tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  Tribulation.  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be  saved. - Matthew 24:13  II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION  \tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ\'s second coming.  Also know as the time of Jacob\'s (Israel\'s) trouble (Jere 30:7) and Daniel\'s Seventieth Week (Dan 9), this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.  III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM  \tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community  (the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable  possession during the Tribulation.  IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  \tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24,  Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you.    V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  \tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray  and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ.    VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS  \tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell, or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be useless.  And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and  slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast,  or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666 - Revelation 13:16-18.   \tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past, such as the Holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -M] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\'s rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ...I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of  them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer,  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed. Revelation 6:9, 11. \tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ...And I saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of  God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands. - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children,  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark.   \tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire. [Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M] You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire.  ...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His  indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. -Revelation  14:9-10   [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --M]   VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL  \tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\'s government until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake. \tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the Antichrist\'s control will come last to the least populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation. [As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings --M]  Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [Get a good water filter. --M] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights, batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.  VIII. TRUST NO ONE \t \tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\'s government.  Be on the lookout. [Perot supporters take note --M]  IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST  \tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be  physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and  personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived. [Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M] \tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.   All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.  X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!  \tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you  will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.   \tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of  your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be faithful unto death.  \tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!  ****************************************************************************** Mike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  Christianity is Stupid. v22964qs@ubvms or mike\%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up. -Negativland UB Language Perception Laboratory\t*   ******************************************************************************   //////////////////////////////////   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.',0

[ vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the SunSpot Gopher Archive ]        This part is _not_ supported from scripture, nor does it support your    claim that the paradise where Christ descended was exalted.     Making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the    scripture     Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison, is now changed from    a Pre-Easter postion to post-easter by God postion is not supportable.      Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...       Yes, and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading   of the scriptures. You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural    proof need to be cross-checked. The referencs that you supply often do   not support your postion, if they are read in the context of the scripture.    \tHow about that those who have been in paradise, and have accepted \tthe gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ, and then return to the \tpresence of God.

504,'To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..    From the March 1993 Aero Vision (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the   McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude   of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational   settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social   studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available   either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything   needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.   Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-   7302.    By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is it an advertisement to buy the product.

800,'  If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you love vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn\'t even think of flying it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform.   Not to this degree.   Why?   Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle isn\'t reusable, it\'s salvagable).   The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.   The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80\% of available thrust and still land safely.   Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that\'s not the same thing. Shuttle simply isn\'t a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.   You don\'t put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You wouldn\'t for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you?   You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO.   Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn\'t. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn\'t.   Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will carry passengers.   I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.   Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for opponents of manned space to kill it.   The only way to prove those things is to build it.    Allen ',2

166,'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer.   I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter O there are two outlines:  \t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font) \t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes. The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:  \t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple \t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for \t\tsome fancy fonts). \t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can\'t tell which method is the best to implement.  Thanks for any pointers.  --> Rob Lansdale ',1

So I suppose I should just ignore the pain, because holding my hand over the candle is something I just want to do. I\'ve got the right, don\'t I?  Your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong.  It\'s your body\'s alarm system informing you that something needs your attention.  A fever tells you that you are sick, and need some sort of care.  Guilt can be seen as that emotional or spiritual alarm, just informing you that there is something that you\'ve done that requires your attention.  It doesn\'t require a personality type to become a believer.  It requires someone who is willing to listen to themselves, their body & soul.    = All I know is that I don\'t know everything. And frankly speaking = I don\'t care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I\'m not  = perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy = and inspiring life.  For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping \'cid (LSD). Frankly speaking, I didn\'t really care.  It was fun anyway.  It didn\'t matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a  *tremendously* greater risk of serious birth defects.  For several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women as I could convice.  Frankly speaking, I didn\'t care.    I didn\'t care that I was putting each one of them at risk (as well as their future partners).  It didn\'t matter that for the first decade of my marriage, my wife and I will have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something *much* worse than a cold.  =  = There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice = thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden, = the shoulders feel far more relaxed!  The nice thing about pain killers, if you take enough, you won\'t care about  the fever, shortness of breath or pain. ',3
1191,'  Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says  that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary. The sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people to keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not keep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.  Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike (Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of food we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (Col. 2.)   I don\'t think that the Sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally irrelevant to modern Christians, but what about Collosions 2, where it says that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?',3

140,'  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of higher truth is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither higher or  lower; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one\'s discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God\'s creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.',3

1687,' In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don\'t have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.',2

608,'Piper lived in my town (Williamsport, PA) when he killed himself.  It was in the early \'60\'s.

294,' Well, this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt.atheism, where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system, without resorting to accusing others of bigotry.  It\'s somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I\'ve seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.',0

The word you\'re groping for is some.  #Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.  No shit, Sherlock.

Can you formalise your argument? #  #Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make #B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that #it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis.

1731,'      Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the \'30\'s.  For much of the \'20\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It\'s important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd\'s _America_.  When it\'s time to railroad, you railroad.     Not off the top of my head; I\'ll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator\'s Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked.

I haven\'t read Lewis\'s article, so I can\'t comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read Orientalism by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title Islam and Women, reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur\'an and contains numerous Qur\'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says I am a Muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur\'an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by following the Qur\'an that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.',0
1282,' Not entirely.  Its not a premise, its a conclusion.  Second, that scientists (for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity.  Scientists are empircists, not theologians.   So do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and  fundamental misunderstanding of science.   Absolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40\% complete, and about 80\% taking into  consideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just  like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of  other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially*  reconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.   But forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and  test out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked us here too?  It won\'t go away, Bill.      So *you* and other fundamentalists say.  What about the billions who don\'t  say so?  Beware of people who say they have the truth, Bill, and reconsider each time you think you do.   That was not your point, Bill.  Your point above was God *has* the power .... Scientists generally agree with that.  That\'s a far cry from saying God did. Please attempt to understand your own posts.    I have your info, and I have replied - several days ago.
