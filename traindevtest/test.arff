187,'I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn\'t work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the normalized vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don\'t have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.  Ed  Thanks to all who answered so far.',1

1792,'Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]        Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations, since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations, in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than public relations, in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie The Last Action Hero.  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.   This is being disputed, since the launch is a commercial launch and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL BILLBOARDS    Orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in The Man Who Sold the Moon.  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the Eiffel II project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.

680,': >Why not build a inflatable space dock.  : If you\'re doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.  That\'s a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked Why not, I\'ll respond.  Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don\'t think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it\'s more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.  Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.  The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.  These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368',2

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don\'t know what all this is about, read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didn\'t you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn\'t you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn\'t the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is \'Yes, but what has it to  do with this package???\' , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can\'t understand a word, don\'t worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don\'t have to worry about that if you don\'t want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100\% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select \'OOP-Guild\'.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

1970,'I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.  Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation:                                 DMPEG V1.0                         Public Domain MPEG decoder                             by Stefan Eckart   0. Features ===========  DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:    - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard    (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)   - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display   - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)   - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale   - color-space selection   - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required   - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)   - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for    VGA and many Super-VGAs  ...  4. Technical information ========================  The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn\'t it?), which turned out to be faster than a \'fast\' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).  Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.  Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas.  ... ',1

787,'FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY                        by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist                           Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody knew that a            heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would            violate the laws of physics.  All of the experts and            authorities said so.                            For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  The            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of            force, can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be.                            Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright            Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final            word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they            crash).                            Today, orthodox physicists and other scientists are            saying similar things against several kinds of \'Free Energy\'            Technologies, using negative terms such as pseudo-science            and perpetual motion, and citing so-called laws which            assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed (1st law            of thermodynamics) and there is always a decrease in useful            energy (2nd law of thermodynamics).  The physicists do not            know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare            that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF            IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern science and help to            cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox            modern theories.                            Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-           OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT            SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated            pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment.                            Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy,            but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by            various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices,            they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they            can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy            has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and            often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly            designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                            For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058,            #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for            motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earth\'s magnetic            field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to            be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in            Science & Mechanics magazine, Spring 1980, (Amazing            Magnet-Powered Motor, by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117,            and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes,            orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.

They typically have a \'SPARK GAP\' in the circuit            which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped.  It is important that the total            \'inductance\' and \'capacitance\' of the Device combine to            \'RESONATE\' at the same frequency as \'EARTH RESONANCE\' in            order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be            increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \'NEUTRAL CENTER\'            of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a            Tesla Coil, slipping a \'TOROID CHOKE COIL\' around the            secondary coil will enhance output power.  [Earth Energy:            Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems, by John Bigelow, 1976,            Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.]                            During the 1930\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named            Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an            \'IMPLOSION TURBINE\' (German name, \'ZOKWENDLE\'), after            analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped            waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it.  As described in the book A            Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources, by Dan A. Davidson,            1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a            LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump,            which then converts the pump\'s motor into an ELECTRIC            GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earth\'s rotation, via the \'Coriolis effect\', LIKE A            TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                            A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \'McClintock            Air Motor\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between            a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and            planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running            by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also            generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat            buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large            trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.             [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the            automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.]                            Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown            in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector.                            One other energy source should be mentioned here,            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free            Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph            Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION            reactor which he calls \'Migma\', which uses NON-radioactive            deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities            from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be            converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting            steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the            Tokamaks and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about,            Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in.  [New Times (U.S. version), 6-26-78,            pages 32-40.]                            And then there are the \'cold fusion\' experiments that            have been in the news lately, originally conducted by            University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin            Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake            Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of            chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with            mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which            PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated.                            There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called laws            of thermodynamics are NOT so absolute.  For example, the            late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \'Reciprocal System\', (which he describes in detail            in several books such as Nothing But Motion (1979) and The            Universe of Motion (1984)), in which the physical universe            has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter            half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing            between them, with-OUT the heat death predicted by            thermodynamic laws.  His Theory explains the universe MUCH            BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some            Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow,            seemingly converting low-quality energy into high-quality            energy.                            Also, certain religious organizations such as \'Sant Mat\'            and \'Eckankar\' teach their Members that the physical universe            is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of            existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV            channels, as described in books like The Path of the            Masters, by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and Eckankar: The Key            to Secret Worlds, by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example,            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the \'Astral Plane\'.  Long-time Members of these groups            have learned to \'Soul Travel\' into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given            the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is            supported by many successful laboratory-controlled            experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as            those described in the book Psychic Discoveries Behind the            Iron Curtain.                            In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional            energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their            VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If            the government does not intervene, then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and            pollution and its harmful effects (including the \'GREENHOUSE            EFFECT\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil            spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue            to increase.                            The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development            of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize            private production (until the producers can make it on their            own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of            Free Energy Hardware.                            The long-range effects of such government intervention            would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining            companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$,            etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil,            and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero,            while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\'s,            personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease,            along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be            able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE            USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                            Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of            business, but society as a whole, and the earth\'s environment            and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People,            that government should serve, rather than the big            corporation$ and bank$.

1356,': I will clarify my earlier quote.  God\'s laws were originally written for  : the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here\'s the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God\'s chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God\'s existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God\'s chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don\'t mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn\'t address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today\'s world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I\'ll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don\'t believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don\'t know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don\'t know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I\'ve seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don\'t know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it\'s a lifestyle that changes one\'s : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God\'s will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God\'s will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I\'m doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:',3

260,'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\'d do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default 2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see any evidence of stutter.

Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.

Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  Demand and supply balance will collapse is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.

Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural, real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot, you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for, you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still, I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information, as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article How to find sources. (If you don\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body.  The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful --- it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for canned software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don\'t see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work, you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20, that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files, and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you\'ll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool, and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG, NewAmyJPEG, VJPEG, and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it\'s hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\'t forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article How to find sources, referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\'d like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer, color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already, so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing, and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read, it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why, it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

1697,'Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a good thing by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called The Gay Agenda and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don\'t understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN EX-GAY SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\'s homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians a way out of the homosexual death-style through prayer.  I\'d like to give the award back, Caligiuri now laughs, I\'m no longer deserve it.   Caligiuri\'s eight year involvement with the national ex-gay movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  There\'s no reality in it, he says, I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality, explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that about 80\% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.   Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time, says Lisa Seeley, a former redeemed lesbian who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.   It\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior, says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. But it\'s really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  I was really drunk, he recalls, and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  He had another man there with him, Caligiuri recalls.  I thought at this time, \'If this is what being gay is about, I don\'t want to be this way anymore.   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\'s gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services, Caligiuri says, so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we\'d preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, They\'ll do anything to reach these people.   David used to go on radio and say really stupid things, recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.   Caligiuri\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  They were relieved, he recalls. They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a \'reformed\' gay person.   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  By the time I appeared on Sally\'s show, I\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.  When he wasn\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other reformed homosexuals.   I didn\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another, Caligiuri says.  We\'d go to conferences in other cities, and we\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.   By the time he appeared on \'AM Philadelphia\' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\'s host asked him if he ever acted on temptation, his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri\'s duplicity began to take it\'s toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  I was too sick to go to church, he explains.  The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry\'s doors.  I\'d convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people, he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (I\'m interest- ed in belief systems that aren\'t judgemental.), considering romance (But not with a CHristian!), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes, he says.  I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.  ---end article---  Caligiuri\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of \'ex-gay\' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian Lazarus Project of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as Love In Action and others, who either once claimed to have been reformed or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sin through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for \'suicide\' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\'s _Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\'s _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.',3

935,' Wow! You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as guilt and  morality.  I\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\'t for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be  absolutely impossible.  Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to  attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\'t  illegal, then don\'t pick on me).  I\'m not saying this is wrong, merely  that it is a byproduct of a society which has:  \t1) A high education level, \t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media, \t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and \t4) A me oriented culture.  I guess what I\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition,  here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can can\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we  are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  those freedoms don\'t impinge on another\'s.  IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we  appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old  territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized,  inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the  continued destabilization of society.    I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this  mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms  in order to stabilize society.  Yet I believe development of societies  follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a  social model which maximizes indiv. freed.\'s yet is stable?

The same goes for Dr. Gunn.  : But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that : these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any  : assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them, : raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever : to help these children after birth? :   Here\'s the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality.  If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden, she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung. And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of. It\'s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and we\'ll ruin it the first chance we get.  : Now, I don\'t really know the answer to these questions, but I\'ve got a real : good guess. :   And, it\'s probably right.  : And I wouldn\'t call *that* \'benevolent\', either. :   It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don\'t see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only responsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us feel responsible without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to feel like good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give me the freedom to say I\'m good, and the rest of the world can burn. Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they\'re dead.  I\'ll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I\'ll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government, because it screws me, and don\'t talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites. But, I\'m a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too christian.  At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.  We\'ve become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and of every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the biggest blessing this world can hope to see.  Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?  -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \tI deplore the horrible crime of child murder... \t We want prevention, not merely punishment. \t We must reach the root of the evil... \t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt \t from the dreadful deed... \t No mater what the motive, love of ease, \t\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, \t\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed... \t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her \t\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.',3

Quantum Electro- dynamics (QED - which considers light to be particles) has been experimentally verified to about 14 decimal digits of precision under ALL tested conditions. I\'m afraid that this case, at least in the physics community, has been decided. Laymen should consult QED - The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard P. Feynman and for the more technically minded there\'s The Feynman Lectures on Physics by Feynman, Leighton and Sands (an excellent 3 volumes).  Case closed. ',3
25,'  Ok, so you have proven you saw the right stuff.  However, as I said above, it takes politics and PR to keep the bucks coming. No politics, no bucks, no buck rogers.    Yes this may be true in the case of the SCIENCE data coming from the spacecraft and other stuff about the operations.  However, there is still stuff regarding regular operation that belongs to the company and they have ever legal right to keeping it theirs.  But this does not mean that everything can or should be swept under the umbrella of company proprietory data.    You can do the same here...you just have to wait a year.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a \'controversial\' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community, Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet and Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can\'t find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    Alt.Atheism FAQ:.  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are help and    send atheism/index.  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed; it\'s not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.    it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. ',0

429,'Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator\'s  \tContest Announcement)  WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?  ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer  peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that  uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to  a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR  gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality,  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: =====================================  ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware  protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing,  framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running, without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards, locators, and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and  Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples  of the interface from applications to the device drivers.   To Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):',1

It is an assumption on my part that people with normal values and morality would be more  concerned with human life than sermon structure.

392,'  Sorry, you\'re right.  I did not clearly state it.    The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s), and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there\'s a lack of consistency here.  Now I know you\'ll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational people have problems with that logic?  But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.   ;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?    It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it\'s still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he had wrought.   First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?  One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don\'t want this, but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.  And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God. Can love as a truth be proven, logically?    John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course, I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically, you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant, Jesus, for instance.   I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective.

1226,'[ . . .]  I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of right and wrong (or correct/incorrect or true/false) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is right (correct, true, veridical) or wrong (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\'t be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the rightness of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the correctness of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold different moral values (feelings).',0
1519,'  Thanks for the information!  I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter\'s -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter\'s influence.   Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  \tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU) \tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU) \tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour \tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km \tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC',2

1404,'Hi,  \tI have a problem, I hope some of the \'gurus\' can help me solve.  \tBackground of the problem: \tI have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a  \tmapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d.

1684,'    That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated Interplanetary Network was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say It\'s somewhere in the field of view.).  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the  sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didn\'t mean to, though.  Some believe (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss neutron star...but this is getting too far afield.',2

969,'  I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.  The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC\'s history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry average, and that, in my opinion, SGI\'s history is better than DEC\'s.  (And what is DEC doing with it\'s MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to abandon it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R4400\'s and TFP\'s and R5\'s?)',1

166,'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer.   I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter O there are two outlines:  \t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font) \t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes. The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:  \t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple \t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for \t\tsome fancy fonts). \t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can\'t tell which method is the best to implement.  Thanks for any pointers.  --> Rob Lansdale ',1

1161,'  Diplomatic :-)  I realize I\'m fighting Occam\'s razor in this argument, so I\'ll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, I\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\'re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, \'obfuscate\' the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isn\'t used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but (again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \'if you see object X, then perform action Y,\' and we don\'t seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what conclusions to draw from it\'s experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also, neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\'s code?  The next problem is the sticky question of What is colour? (replace \'colour\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the materialist viewpoint is that it\'s the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a computer won\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn\'t? It shouldn\'t, because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?    A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called \'Unitary Evolution\' (or \'U\'), is governed by Schroedinger\'s equation and is well known. The second process, called various things such as \'collapse of the wavefunction\' or \'state vector reduction\' (or \'R\'), and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a \'measurement\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \'something else,\' which I shall imaginitively call \'part X.\' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the wavefunction. Note, though, that we\'d need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway, I\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear superpositions of anything, although there are alternative explainations for this. I\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X, but since this is only speculation, that won\'t matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.  I\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\'s OK with you :-)   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Kevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk             Don\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.',0

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by anonymous FTP indefinitely.       The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine & Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit, but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process.       This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word, theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and to librarians and information professionals.

482,'Pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable Myco-toxin,  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It\'s immediate administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years, the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude, and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections.  Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease. It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and developement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients.  I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin, but to centoxin.',2

1138,' \tThe first and only thing I\'ve ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines (not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no, dummy, you\'re going the wrong way.  \tSteve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool.  \tIn some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight, clean, and well imaged; you don\'t always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case.  \t(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.

887,'It is interesting to note in the past few days\' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The \'spaceport political publicity\' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don\'t think that nothing has happened.

1012,'   Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break? For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn\'t say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what\'s better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid of your emotions.  And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.    The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It\'s wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is the world an undesireable place a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn\'t.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn\'t.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn\'t.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don\'t follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to priests,  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do not follow Catholicism or any ism.  I follow Christ.   Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and that\'s it.  Don\'t contradict yourself.  You have no reason to live a good life.  It doesn\'t do you any good in the end.  Your life doesn\'t do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail.  Jesus\'s death was like a seed.  He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.

966,'Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this Banner reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the Environmental Billboard.  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Environmental Billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s delicate protective ozone layer, according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s atmosphere. According to IMI, as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer. The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply.    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian\'s questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon someone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding for this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.

941,'Brian Ceccarelli wrote (that\'s me):   Kent Sandvik responds:   I think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn\'t view guilt like our modern venacular colors it.     Feelings have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of  being guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a  reaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the  reaction.   Let me give you an example:  Have you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a little white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really  didn\'t know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish? Are you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You are guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.   Feelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus\'s use of the word guilt as how a court uses it.  Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do bad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our  guilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things.  We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is not a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being.  Guilty as charged.   You can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in the meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.  Or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way  Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this  category to some extent in their lives.  Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That isn\'t new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize  that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him. That is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to  have your company.  You are immensely valuable to him. Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.    God is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into a round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him. God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in Jesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will move it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very being--and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For with the divine nature living within us, we can now see our imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives  within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now  have authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine  nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit is eternal.  The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God. Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the goats from the sheep.   Many people in the last day will ask him, Didn\'t I prophesy in your name and do miracles, and do good things in your name?   And what did Jesus say? Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.  That is the cornerstone of  Christianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your  relationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.     Good.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus taught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before,  in the common english venacular, feeling guilty has a different meaning than the state of guilt.   I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego, a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love. ',3

1000,'I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature. This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:  \tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25 \t Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in .25.  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:  \tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25 \t This results in all the coordinates ending in either 0.25 or 0.75  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS result looks better than how my stuff looks, I\'d like to know if anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.  Thanks,',1

[dictionary definitions of not disagree and agree deleted]  Oh, but I\'m weary of trying to wade through Jim\'s repertoire of  red herrings and smoke screens.  Let\'s see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today through the \'discord\' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont was kind enough to send me):  \tTaking action?

Does running Jim\'s articles through \'discord\' make them more coherent?  Less coherent?  Or has \'discord\' turned Jim\'s articles into an angst-ridden poem about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the getaway car tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our being is not to get away from responsibility for our actions, but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the driver of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?

This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical            law that for every action there is an equal and opposite            REaction.                      It is the ENFORCEMENT, the TEETH, behind The GOLDEN            RULE: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.                  ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in            the future, most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION.  Most            victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually            during a PREVIOUS LIFE.                            What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of            EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in            a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence),            that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this            life or the next.                            Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the            related LAW of Retribution, should read books such as HERE            AND HEREAFTER, by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several            kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including            HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50\% accurate; the            subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially            with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by            young children, some of whom can identify their most recent            previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL            of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off            land while traveling there for the first time on vacation),            the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN            SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including            Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of            Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before            he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!).                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person\'s PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT            life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  People would behave much better toward each other if            they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be            reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!

100,' This is a good point, but I think average people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.

887,'It is interesting to note in the past few days\' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The \'spaceport political publicity\' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don\'t think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm, believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer and don\'t worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur. Stephen Horan shoran@nmsu.edu ',2

However, you may be speaking of Public Missle, Inc., which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while.  Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more  powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable form, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I\'ve heard of used at special occasions.  To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can\'t contain any metal  structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I\'ve never heard of a model rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights. These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large national launches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engine flights.

139,' Wishful thinking mostly. It\'s more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.  Gary',2
532,'   >Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks    >for sounding rockets?     Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the    tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10\% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas  quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I\'ll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.

1082,' OK, here\'s at least one Christian\'s answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God\'s purposes.  Verse 18 says For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, accomplished what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about doing away with the Law.  That was not  Jesus\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be doing  away with the Law because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God\'s Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it\'s purpose, i.e. our tutor to lead us to Christ, and now, we are no longer under a tutor.  The law has been fulfilled  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the last will and testament of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\'s purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the mysteries of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That\'s one Christian\'s explanation.  I don\'t claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.

What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your conversion to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?     To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the  plausibility of God\'s existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new secular religion, and that scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood.  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?)    ---------------  This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.

1657,' Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini\'s ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad. This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis. But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.',0

779,' It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now, there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (x,y)\'s).  2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you        can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the        Reference(x,y).      b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where correct is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and you can\'t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.

467,' The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn\'t hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That\'s war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\'m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\'d be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\'t understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\'s sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\'ve been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!

Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,',0

1662,'  Really>`?   No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don\'t need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone\'s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).',0
850,'   When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving, communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity or parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government, however  they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.  We are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other than ours.   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.   I think it took more than one minute.',0
46,'     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in The Australian Muslim Times, the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don\'t deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim.  In general, anyone who calls themselves a Muslim and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term Muslim is to be contrasted with Mu\'min, which means true believer.  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a true believer or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say Muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu\'min, or true believer in Islam.',0

370,' Well, I could use the argument that some here use about nature and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers you have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence, you cannot have superhuman powers.  Sound good to you?  Anyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group, since you are posting from a american college site, I\'m willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some coherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.   Yep.   Good.   Extra evidence?  Why don\'t we start with evidence at all?  I cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would ever accept.  As for the second, it is the foundation of the religion. Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period) is a believer, and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since these are all ancients anyway, one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else-- even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*, so again I don\'t see how evidence is possible.  I thus interpret the extraordinary claims claim as a statement that the speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter.',0

1201,'Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling between some software cracks...   [Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an  apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn\'t actually  have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn\'t matter to what  follows]  I don\'t know whether I\'m quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back to current affairs,   Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you will, known (according to Umar Khan) to Every Muslim school boy and girl, and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.   Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing the actor Gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took. Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened.  It\'s somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer, consider Salman Rushdie\'s children\'s book Haroun and the Sea of Stories for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific storyteller -- works with existing story lines.   No.  Muhammad\'s [Mahound\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story, and there\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\'s intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and satanic), though he doesn\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied (in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:       *Not my voice* I\'d never know such words I\'m no classy speaker     never was never will be but this isn\'t my voice it\'s a Voice.       Mahound\'s eyes open wide, he\'s seeing some kind of vision,     staring at it, oh, that\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He\'s     seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don\'t     know, can\'t say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my     mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.       Being God\'s postman is no fun, yaar.       Butbutbut: God isn\'t in this picture.       God knows whose postman I\'ve been.  It\'s ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan? Or something else?  The answer is not given.  To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation, but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very existence of a newsgroup named alt.atheism raises the same questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is the real relevance.  If Rushdie\'s mild fictional exploration is filth and lies, and he asked for what he got, are we next on the fatwa list?

936,'  Yes.  Here\'s what you should do.  Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay, but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it, so you don\'t have to transform any vertex more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don\'t have to be transformed at all.  Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it\'s on the far side of the hither plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.  Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage. ',1
893,'Archive-name: space/new_probes Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $  UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES      Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below     would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s     satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn\'s rings.  \t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory) \t ------------------------------------------------------------- \t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch \t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist \t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist \t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist \t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist \t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival \t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release \t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry \t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission \t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)       GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

1953,'    In fact, you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring NASA  altogether.  The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a Conestoga flying  a COMET payload.

629,'Hello netters,     I\'m new to this board and I thought this might be the best place for my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie Patriot Games.

I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My question is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is, one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.

In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say.   If you like I\'ll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes. At least the headings haven\'t changed much.',0
470,' Then delete the unfortunately.   Now tell me that the two statement say effectively the same thing.  And to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop, please notice that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self.   We can choose *not* to preserve self, which is the point of pacifism.   And in this case they don\'t prescribe the same things, so.....   If you don\'t think the use of force is immoral, why minimise its use?',3
1683,'    I\'m not sure what you mean by \'saving face\' unless you are confusing the FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the original search warrant.   Independant Negotiators? What was there to negotiate? Any sort of plea bargin has to be brought to the court, the negotiators can\'t negotiate charges or sentences. FBI negotitators did make a deal for the Dividians to come out.

893,'Archive-name: space/new_probes Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $  UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES      Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below     would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s     satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn\'s rings.  \t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory) \t ------------------------------------------------------------- \t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch \t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist \t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist \t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist \t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist \t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival \t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release \t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry \t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission \t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)       GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned     the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to     Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have     essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70\% of its original objectives.  \t   Galileo Schedule \t   ---------------- \t   10/18/89 - Launch from Space Shuttle \t   02/09/90 - Venus Flyby \t   10/**/90 - Venus Data Playback \t   12/08/90 - 1st Earth Flyby \t   05/01/91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled \t   07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage \t   10/29/91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby \t   12/08/92 - 2nd Earth Flyby \t   05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage \t   08/28/93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby \t   07/02/95 - Probe Separation \t   07/09/95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver \t   12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons \t   12/07/95 - Jupiter/Io Encounter \t   07/18/96 - Ganymede \t   09/28/96 - Ganymede \t   12/12/96 - Callisto \t   01/23/97 - Europa \t   02/28/97 - Ganymede \t   04/22/97 - Europa \t   05/31/97 - Europa \t   10/05/97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration       HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made     multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,     into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon.       MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.       OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron     Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro     Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).

103,'I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.    First of all, I\'ve tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it\'s possible to give  succinct answers to most everything, but there\'s enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours, I\'m sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean  it) is great, but it\'s also important for me to have as broad a base of  individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it\'s a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.    Secondly, I hope some of the questions don\'t come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like What would convince you of the existence of God imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact, I\'m not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of God is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it\'s easier  than just repeating a deity or higher power every time.    Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system although I know some of you might contend that you don\'t have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.    ---------------  Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum  \tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?   Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.     In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe  in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume  that the answer to this is yes; if you\'ve always been an atheist, or at least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)   How serious was your/your family\'s involvement?    How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?    How and when did your final break with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I  realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se; whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.     What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your conversion to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?     To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the  plausibility of God\'s existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new secular religion, and that scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood.  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?)    ---------------  This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.    ---------------  Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I\'m doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what I\'ve asked about above.  ',0
