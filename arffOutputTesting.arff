If there is truly no alternative, then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim.  The usual line here, which you call a prejudgment of atheism, and dispute, is that reason is all we have.  Here you admit that you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim that there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in religious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with religious knowledge.  This sounds very much like I can\'t provide a rational defense for my belief, but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false.

Not only is it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every (wo)man\'s altruism (can you say black market under communisim anyone?), but the current methods of resource production are entirely energy dependant.  There are not enough sources of cheap capital (aside from human capital) to allow us to stop looking at space a an excellent source of materials and realestate.

Perhaps we should boycott those games?

16,' Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries too, are all measures of size.  In this case I\'d say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area.   Vietnam and Korea might make good comparisons.   Western news in general, but in particular the American mass media: CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor, poor Iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits.   I agree.   Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that\'s easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90\'s, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of  thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and  millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and  other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All  things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, don\'t regret it.   Sure.  And it\'s the people who suffer because of them.  All the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests!  Or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well??   I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and  threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\'s oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.   Well, it\'s not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\'d have to say yes, stopping Hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.  I mentioned it.  If we hadn\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia.   Sure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich.  The consequences stemmed from that.  What should I say about them?  Anything in particular?    So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black officers involved, I\'m sure their would have been black jurors too. This point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.   So?  It\'s hard to imagine?  So when has Argument from Incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of Constructing a Logical Argument?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)   I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution nor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to the silence of the principals.     OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved. And frankly, the original not guilty verdict baffled me too.  But then I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\'s evident that  the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty.  Note,  not not guilty of doing wrong, but not guilty of aggravated assault  with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the  prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a  verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.  If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then I feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one.   Thanks mathew, I like the quote.  Pretty funny actually.  (I\'m a  Monty Python fan, you know.  Kind of seems in that vein.)  Of course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory.  But then, you know that already.

Knies <ISSCCK@BYUVM#.B #>As a Latter-day Saint, I found John\'s statement *not at all* ludicrous... #> #>Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri, #>governor Boggs, issued his so-called Mormon extermination order.  The #>only crime (illegal activity) the Latter-day Saints had committed, was #>their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still #>allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri. #> #>I guess the Mormons got what they deserved, because they refused to bow #>to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This disobedience #>brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from #>their lands and settlements... # #It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by #average people, and that at the time, almost all Americans were pretty #homogeonously Christian. It was largely the mainstream Christian\'s disgust #at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.  True, but that is exactly the problem: the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this order from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in an earlier posting, your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs\' Lieutenant; he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation, lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.  In intent and purpose, what really has changed?  #The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings #and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don\'t think most of them #are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and #perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification #which discourages critical thought.  True, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you\'re aware.  #>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and #>I don\'t even discuss how Uthan\'s were suckered into allowing part of their #>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from #>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I #>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the #>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church #>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-Peace Keeper #>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another inspired decision from #secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough #for the feds to back off. # #Do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of #people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the #Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for #nuclear testing etc.. was to get them thar Mormons?  And what about the #majority of Uthan\'s who aren\'t Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy  ^^^^^^^^ (Correction: the majority of Utahn\'s ARE Mormon (60-70\% I believe, up to a  100\% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)  #conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you #badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.  What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and evil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don\'t you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?  As far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have brought death, disease, (i.e. the downwinders) and environmental contami- nation.  I am hardly paranoid, I am just not expecting too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed (as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of fact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global) persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that (paraphrasing) all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to Zion.  Zion (the pure in heart) will be re-established in those days, and it AIN\'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...  #>...

The Christian Bible says that one may kill #under certain circumstances.   In fact, it instructs one to kill under #certain circumstances.       I\'d say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them to kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism \'allows\' atoricities, then that\'s an indictment of that theism.  But it rather depends on what the \'certain circumstances\' are.  When you talk about Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood. It\'s when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls apart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly harmless. # #|> For my part, I conclude that something #|> else is required.  I also happen to believe that that something #|> else will work no less well without religion - any easy Them/Us will #|> do. # #And what does religion supply, if not an easy Them/Us?  Not necessarily.  Love thy neighbour does not supply a them/us - it demolishes it.

That was religously motivated. # #What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic  #labourers?     That *wasn\'t* religiously motivated?  Not in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don\'t do this (nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it\'s just too broad too say religion did this.  I\'m saying that the causes are far more complex than that - take away the religious element, and you\'d still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say \'stop the  killing\', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not to read minds. # # #|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions, #|> and the many religous wars. # #What\'s so special about these exceptions?    Isn\'t this all just a #grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders #to be religiously motivated?    What\'s the general principle behind #all this?  The general principle is that it\'s fairly clear (to me, at least) that religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.

The author is not responsible for any          damage caused by this program.  Important changes since Version 1.35:   Added support for IRIS.   Support Mix/Concat. two images.   Added support for \'batch conversion\'.   Added support for \'load/save palette table\'.   Added support for \'edge enhance\'.   Added support for \'crop one line\'.   Added support for \'negate image\'.   New color quantization option.   Fix some minor bugs.  (1) Introduction:   This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different   formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)   on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different   formts.   Include simple file management system.   Support \'slide show\'. + Support \'batch conversion\'.   There is NO LIMIT on image size.   Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.   If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.   If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).   (2) Hardware Requirement:   PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.   min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).   (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).   Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

(7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter \'read\' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy       files, you will enter \'write\' menu. the \'write\' menu is much like       \'read\' menu, but only allow you to change directory.       The header line in \'read\' menu includes (d:xx,f:xx,t:xx).         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in \'read\' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in \'read\' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in \'read\' menu will do \'Slide Show\'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep. +       \'w\' or \'W\' to pause, any key to continue.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in \'read\' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in \'read\' menu will quit program without prompting. +     pressing F5 will turn on \'effect\' menu.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter \'screen\' menu.       You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter \'write2\' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you \'original\' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you \'selected\' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don\'t have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,      COMMENT about this program,      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.

521,'Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my  question about which countries engage in space surveillance.  Unfortunately, I apparently didn\'t make the meaning of the message  clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance,  rather than space surveillance        What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at  the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have  programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of)  satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).       The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating  quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and  electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so.  The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing.       Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches  and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track  of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren\'t available.  See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as  the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The  material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in  optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be  that other countries do also.

So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that.  So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood etc. Now you are saying:   If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a *lot* easier.  ----------------   Eh? Sorry, I don\'t understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this paragraph defeats me.   Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.  But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:    ---------------    No I don\'t think so actually.   You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising), manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?   Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!   I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.   ??? What are you saying ???   Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem!!    Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.   Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an approach clumsy, however.   Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don\'t seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one through.    As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.   Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who, having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette.  Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?   Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.   Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)  Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for. It makes no false claims.   If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So  far, you have not done so.   Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily\'. OK, go ahead and code it if it is so easy.  Or alternatively, look up the terms `import\' and \'non-reversible transformation\'.   I think this is a bit of an exageration.  What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...   you bet   Mostly.

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural, real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot, you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for, you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still, I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information, as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.)

Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \'xv-???.tar.Z\' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \'contrib\' directory on export or the \'pub/xv\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\'t use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they\'ll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work, you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20, that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files, and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you\'ll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool, and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG, NewAmyJPEG, VJPEG, and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\'t forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article How to find sources, referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\'d like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer, color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already, so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing, and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read, it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why, it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\'t like it - that\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense. That you don\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\'ve been conditioned; there is no truth content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn\'t make these rules, it\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.',87,74,74,75,3490,0.0,122,3,0,28.60655737704918,109,0,0,0,Atheism

680,': >Why not build a inflatable space dock.  : If you\'re doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.  That\'s a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked Why not, I\'ll respond.  Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to  incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable). Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. Don\'t think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it\'s more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.  Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.  The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation effects on materials), so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.  These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368',55,48,64,48,1853,0.0,74,11,1,25.04054054054054,0,0,77,0,Space

The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine & Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit, but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process.       This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word, theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local computer support person.  If you have questions or comments about the CONTENT of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov while if you have any questions or comments on the SYSTEM please contact me.  -- K.D.

107,' He is God.   He is God.   God granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.    The scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and learn about its behaviour.  He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For example, let\'s say the scientist creates a Tyrannosaurus Rex and it breaks free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist would not hesitate in killing it.  God creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in  our love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him. God cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God, one that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is worthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out such duties because we are not worthy.    God is God.  Who are we to question the Creator?  If you doubt God\'s doing in certain situations, do you claim to know a better solution?  Would you be playing the role of God?',33,25,26,32,1034,0.0,29,0,0,35.6551724137931,0,0,0,32,Religion
1186,'   This is a heavily edited/modified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a client and jump into Gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained as described below.  Once you have a gopher client point it at  merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!   Dan Jacobson  danj@welchgate.welch.jhu.edu  -----  Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a client/server protocol for making a world wide information service, with many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher,  comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.  The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or via anonymous ftp:  rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq  Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body to find out how to do FTP by e-mail.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:  Q0:  What is Gopher? Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software? Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher? Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher? Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software? Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? Q7: What is veronica? Q8: What is Available for Biology? ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q0:  What is Gopher?  A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed      information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide      information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While      providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher      facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers      throughout the world.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?  A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory      /pub/gopher  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?  A2:  You will need a gopher client program that runs on your local PC      or workstation       There are clients for the following systems.  The directory      following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous      ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory      /pub/gopher.

Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client      itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:         Type=1        Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu        Port=70        Path=        Name=Gopher Software Distribution.         Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and      look in the gopher directory.        There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.      The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine      consultant.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more      information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client      software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A      client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,      scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to      in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?  A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize      network lag.       Telnet Public Logins:       Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area      ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------      consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4\tgopher  North America      gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America      panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201\tpanda   North America      gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe      info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia      gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden      tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America      ecnet.ec\t\t           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador      gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan        It is recommended that you run the client software instead of      logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the      custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)      and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file      to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?  A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University      of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help      our campus find answers to their computer questions.         It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information      System used by a large number of sites in the world.       Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to      count.        The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:           Internet Gopher Developers       100 Union St. SE #190       Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA       Or via FAX at:         +1 (612) 625-6817  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?  A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.      As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:               - Search local WAIS indices.        - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?  A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :       _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O\'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:                              ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)       _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet\'s Guide to Our World Online      By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to       Computerized Archives.       veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles      in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica       is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher      items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.      Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy      to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the      gopher protocol.       To try veronica, select it from the Other Gophers menu on       Minnesota\'s gopher server, or point your gopher at:       Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)       Type=1       Port=70       Path=1/veronica       Host=futique.scs.unr.edu  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q8: What is Available for Biology?

755,' Well, let me see if I can explain it.  It\'s similar to collecting coins, or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about everything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something of an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really; it\'s just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in having TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance (this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.  Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you use your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect.  It\'s just personal preference.  Oops, \'personal preference\' ... I guess we\'re not supposed to have that any more, are we?',44,42,40,42,1210,0.0,64,0,0,18.90625,0,0,0,44,Religion

Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items replaced on this mission. The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and I think the new ones are too.

1205,' Yes, that\'s exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was being taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in errors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are guilty of their lifestyle, that pride in one\'s work is a bad thing, that Jesus died for me -- I don\'t want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an impersonal act where the person can\'t possibly even *know* me well enough to really know if I\'m worth dying for or not.  I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus\'s death being a good thing.  If that means that I\'m just not comprehending a basic message of Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I\'m just not compatible with Christianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I can\'t even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it, I\'ve got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.   Don\'t think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I don\'t believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder -- not because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren\'t* in my character.  You may think there\'s nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I\'m able, insulting people for the heck of it, because I\'m not answerable to anyone; but you\'d be wrong.  I\'m answerable to myself.  A life like that would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.   My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the \'presence\' of God with me.  I finally decided that I had once felt this presence just as I had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a little tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.  Since then, I\'ve never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in my darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for a moment and called out to whatever\'s out there, because I want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I have not yet received an answer.   Nope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional sphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts on this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on.  That is, there\'s no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be, so there\'s no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor had anything to do with it.   Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt trips, insinuations that I\'m without morals, arguments from disbelief (how can you possibly believe that God *doesn\'t* exist?), and so forth.  All I\'m asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced, but it\'s not going to be easy.   Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it\'s got these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly intolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you\'ll say that your religion doesn\'t teach that -- but I\'ve got to judge Christianity from the Christians I know.  I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one\'s self, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that.  So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy, fulfilled life.  I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice things.

Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects, that either 1) don\'t increace light pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the target area.  You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites. I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that SPS\'s weren\'t that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.  #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I\'d like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned, and something any project like that would work against anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don\'t think there\'s going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you\'ll find many activists in Murmansk demanding the natural sky back. If anything, he\'ll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp, making sure he\'ll get enough vitamin D for the day.  The mirror experiments aren\'t something they\'re doing for crass advertising. They think that if they can build one, it\'ll be one of those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn\'t have lived without before. And I doubt anyone\'s going to really be able to convince them to stop.  ',74,70,80,68,2068,0.0,80,4,0,25.85,0,0,68,0,Space

I\'ll repost it, since I always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread, I don\'t want Rob to think I\'m doing so.  Since this is now dated, however, don\'t feel compelled to respond...   I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value interpretation...   While the context of the time is important, value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people, for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the Bible\'s own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.   Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see no support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn\'t mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.   Note that I\'m speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance claiming that Hammurabi\'s an eye for an eye was primitive brutal retribution, while Moses\' version was an enlightened benign fine (because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As of 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.   I don\'t belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual ones, of the Jewish people.  I have given up on trying to think by analogy, since I don\'t know of any other \'tribe\' that is at all similar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I don\'t know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison).  I think a tradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation, is a good thing.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a clearing house for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three Program Divisions serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of EnviroLeague Teams, either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the draft portions of the Mentor\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\'s founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\'s Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named EnviroLeague. ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.

The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn\'t work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the normalized vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don\'t have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  What is atheism?  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the weak atheist position, and the latter as strong atheism.  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  Weak atheism is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  Strong atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists.  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  But isn\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\'t exist?  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  What is agnosticism then?  The term \'agnosticism\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (strong) atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism, and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism.  Beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\'t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it\'s best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  But isn\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don\'t exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\'t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  But what if God is essentially non-detectable?  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don\'t exist?  OK, you may think there\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn\'t it still a religious belief?  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game.  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact, but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isn\'t atheism a religious belief? depends crucially upon what is meant by religious.  Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   religion according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  OK, so it\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?  Firstly, it\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called acts of faith, then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain.  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\'t really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  If atheism is not religious, surely it\'s anti-religious?  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against, friend or enemy.  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be anti-religion.  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being anti-religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a live and let live attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to convert others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of state atheism came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  But if you don\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that\'s the same as state atheism?  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  What about prayer in schools? If there\'s no God, why do you care if people  pray?  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don\'t pray can\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\'t  atheists object to the religious charities?  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\'t worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\'s somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To weak atheists, building a hospital to say I do not believe in God is a rather strange idea; it\'s rather like holding a party to say Today is not my birthday.  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  You said atheism isn\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  How do atheists differ from religious people?  They don\'t believe in God.  That\'s all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  Unexceptional? But aren\'t atheists less moral than religious people?  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don\'t obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (right) and unacceptable (wrong) behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti-social or immoral behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don\'t know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after born again experiences.  While only 4\% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being born again, 12\% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5\% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9\% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5\% after.                                 [Freethought Today, September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  Is there such a thing as atheist morality?  If you mean Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?, then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?, then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world \'ought\' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  Then aren\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90\% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  But don\'t atheists want to believe in God?  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the Big Brother figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as Of course God is there, you just aren\'t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  Isn\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning.  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking What is the meaning of life? is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?.  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\'s just hard luck.  Don\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?  The short answer is No, do you?  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven\'t resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\'t the same arguments  apply?  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  What sort of harm?  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\'s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church\'s opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  Those weren\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\'s hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\'s a REAL Christian and who isn\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can\'t decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\'t be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\'t he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren\'t a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don\'t exist, but that doesn\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  Well, if atheism\'s so great, why are there so many theists?  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is, or whether it works; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\'s worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\'s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of memes -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\'s up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it\'s probably the only one you\'ll have.     It\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something\'s popular doesn\'t mean it\'s good.     If you must assume something, assume something it\'s easy to test.     Don\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.

So it\'s more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)

384,' I think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that God definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a theist.    You\'re missing something here.  There are people who convert from non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I don\'t have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an interesting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don\'t want to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is nothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy. Religion also describes things we don\'t know about the universe (things science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok. That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their belief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it\'s kind of useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too (they can\'t accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they are running from).  Anyway, I\'m getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism doesn\'t have to be ingrained into a child\'s mindset for that person to grow up as a theist (although this happens far too often).  Theism is designed to have its own attractions. ',76,58,66,68,1777,0.0,52,0,0,34.17307692307692,0,0,0,32,Religion

INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE  This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying see, the source really does say B, it\'s right here!; this reply does not refute the allegation of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.  Example of the first type: The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in these ways.  We can both agree these are immoral.  The Koran clearly says in this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way.  Example of the second type: There are two Biblical creation stories.

496,'I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases. The idea behind the statement is as follows:       if you smack two neutron       stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,       a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a       cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy        is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes       thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.       The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must       be wrong. As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the \'fireball\' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding  medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the  so-called \'failed supernovae\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario.  On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must  ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.',61,62,67,55,2785,0.0,69,0,0,40.36231884057971,0,0,99,0,Space

I\'ll continue to re-post periodically until *** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won\'t answer them, *** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells *** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the  *** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I\'m at a loss *** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and  *** seeming intellectual dishonesty. *** *** This is re-post #3.   Charley,  I can\'t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don\'t answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I\'ll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren\'t referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don\'t fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by, and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn\'t help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don\'t retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn\'t respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    As usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.  --Dave Wood   p.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley\'s responses to these challenges to date.  3/18/93  3/31/93 (#1)  3/31/93 (#2)',71,75,67,59,4918,0.0,247,24,0,19.910931174089068,141,0,0,0,Atheism

321,'From article <1993May1.092058.1@aurora.alaska.edu>, by pstlb@aurora.alaska.edu:   Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is what AI students do when they\'re really supposed to be doing something else, e.g. thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors\' pet programs to run properly, etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it. Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.  In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs. At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should \'Get back to the keyboard\' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I\'m inclined to agree.  (I don\'t claim to be a superhacker, but I don\'t think that invalidates my remarks. And I\'m sure this isn\'t the whole story.)  ',39,41,46,36,1171,0.0,64,14,2,18.296875,0,36,0,0,Graphics

And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that state\'s reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the same.

In Japanese, with abstract in English.      This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS (experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13, 1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <---- station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also discussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was launched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <---- satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <---- optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <---- useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <---- stages.

RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343      Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross  section are determined from a series of observations made with a high- power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data  processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of  orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail  echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary,  they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <---- observations using a much higher frequency.

In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program. Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p Publication Date: Jun. 1986       As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere  troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar  features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large  VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier  feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast  beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the  antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal  division/combination are performed at a low signal level using  electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna  beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the  zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element  is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful  calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna  element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for  this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to  make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern  monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific  satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna  Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400  watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement  and results are discussed. ',54,63,76,50,4975,0.0,267,65,0,18.632958801498127,0,0,283,0,Space

The material in John (I\'m not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I\'ll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke Q material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus\' mouth.

111,' Sadly understandable...   Yes.  To be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.   Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn\'t say all that many things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation.   This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.   Interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant, unfortunately.

ALL of them.  \t\tDon\'t tell me they do not exist.  They are standard \t\tequipment.  \t2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?  \t\ta)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This \t\t  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable \t\t  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.  \t\t\t.... gotcha!  \t\t  ... when in isolation from other substances.  \t\t  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote \t\t  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce this window, \t\t  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come \t\t  down, and maintain a left to right sequence?  \t\tb)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when \t\t  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace) \t\t  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to \t\t  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long \t\t  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend \t\t  to ignite.  \t\t\tWhat other chemicals come up in the forensics? \t\t\tWho else will be allowed to test the site?  \t\tc)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation \t\t  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made \t\t  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature \t\t  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain \t\t  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length \t\t  of time (start a wall fire and wait).  \t\t\tCheck your military records; look at the tapes. \t\t\tWhy were tanks (large capacity delivey systems), \t\t\ttear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why \t\t\tthe hurry. was there still a comm channel open \t\t\tto the outside?).  \t\t\tDo you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the \t\t\tcompound in the videos?

771,' Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being a Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the fundy part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and wish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it matter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been satisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.  With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you to re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume that defense of Koresh\' right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh\' theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch- Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days.  Nor do I think Koresh\' sex life should be of any interest to the federal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least that\'s how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa- gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him.    But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the building in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with Davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.  Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh is quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all. So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One who has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let\'s clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves.  --Joe Gaut',78,59,72,78,2662,0.0,56,0,0,47.535714285714285,0,0,0,85,Religion

851,' Yes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.  This is true in exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians\' disbelief in Zeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts. Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.  The weak atheist position is logically extremely assailable -- any logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak atheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail miserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist position do so on this basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound; therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do not exist.  This doesn\'t apply to such philosophers\' gods as are defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite questionable.

Give a man a fishing rod, and he\'ll laze around fishing and never do anything.  With that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant information posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year\'s papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??), \tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff  \tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu \tNewsgroups: comp.graphics \tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem \tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon, so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See PostScript Language, by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then outputs the answer.  By output, we mean the program executes a command called showpage, which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.   \t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the \treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of \tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of \tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.  \t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the \tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in \tother words, will it halt?  \tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a \tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is \tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn \tout to be undecidable.   I won\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he\'s hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\'s ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

952,' (about my reply)   It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn\'t it?   Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little about, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the lines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical \'insight\' cannot be algorithmic in his book _The emperor\'s new mind: Concerning computers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose\'s claim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look, could be just illusions.  We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, realising that it might not be anything special, but certainly useful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds or not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave  just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of C. elegans from the elements. Would such a worm have a mind?   This is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains work like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence (Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less chaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve. Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.   Indeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms.   Kevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again. I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not  flame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are conscious.   The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.  And please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\'t.   Again, _brains are not computers_. Don\'t forget this. This does not mean they need something else to work - they just work differently. Their primary \'purpose\' is perception and guidance of action,  self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.   You are still expecting that we could find the idea of \'green\' in our brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is not how I see it. The sensation \'green\' is a certain time-dependent pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain.   Indeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns, but this is just idle speculation.  Scientific American\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on mind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-) There are two articles on visual perception, so you might be  interested.  But again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be  observed from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but  neuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind.  Kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the  patients\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area was stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.  Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations, when the patients have started flirting with the therapist.  In conclusion, there is evidence that  1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences,     brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage  2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in    various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our    visual cortex is activated etc.  3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our    actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead    of our \'conscious will\' by at least 350 ms.   Thus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question Why do \'I\' see colours around and ask What is this \'I\' that seems to be  observing?, since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains.   This depends on what is meant by \'seeing colours\'. Does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?  If you are asking, why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesn\'t, I have a good answer - read my previous posting, where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally, so that they don\'t unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme, but this is the basic idea.)  When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools,  a sense of identity and the concept of \'self\' had to evolve in line with this development. Indeed, respect for others and  conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals, such as early humans.    If minds are required for this, does this mean that until human minds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained in the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.  This has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant, since we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do physicists.    I agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)   It\'s OK, if you don\'t forget to take with you the references I wrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:  Kalat, James W.

QUOTE:  He has been known to answer questions concerning universal truths with  screams.  With suggestive silence.  By peeing down his pants leg.

636,'I replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some issues that are worth discussing in public.   I would recommend you to take a look at  1) your dictionary 2) alt.atheism FAQ files  to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_. I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without paying careful attention to this issue.    IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I\'m sure the replies might keep you amused for hours.   No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual philosophies, fine, but that\'s not strictly atheism. Atheism is not just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life, the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could hardly be called a philosophical system.  Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities.  Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on.  Some comments on your questions:   I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to \'convert\' anyone?   This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_  cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be  beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.  Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))   This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.  Sigh, why haven\'t I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net, anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

1050,'  Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also lead to intolerance.  So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don\'t think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur\'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur\'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur\'an has to give all verses of the Qur\'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur\'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur\'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur\'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran\'s message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let\'s try to understand what the Qur\'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur\'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let\'s try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.',84,66,67,69,2514,0.0,86,0,0,29.232558139534884,66,0,0,0,Atheism
941,'Brian Ceccarelli wrote (that\'s me):   Kent Sandvik responds:   I think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn\'t view guilt like our modern venacular colors it.     Feelings have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of  being guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a  reaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the  reaction.   Let me give you an example:  Have you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a little white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really  didn\'t know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish? Are you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You are guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.   Feelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus\'s use of the word guilt as how a court uses it.  Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do bad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our  guilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things.  We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is not a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being.  Guilty as charged.   You can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in the meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.  Or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way  Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this  category to some extent in their lives.  Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That isn\'t new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize  that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him. That is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to  have your company.  You are immensely valuable to him. Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.    God is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into a round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him. God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in Jesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will move it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very being--and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For with the divine nature living within us, we can now see our imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives  within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now  have authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine  nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit is eternal.  The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God. Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the goats from the sheep.   Many people in the last day will ask him, Didn\'t I prophesy in your name and do miracles, and do good things in your name?   And what did Jesus say? Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.  That is the cornerstone of  Christianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your  relationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.     Good.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus taught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before,  in the common english venacular, feeling guilty has a different meaning than the state of guilt.   I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego, a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don\'t know what all this is about, read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didn\'t you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn\'t you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn\'t the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is \'Yes, but what has it to  do with this package???\' , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can\'t understand a word, don\'t worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don\'t have to worry about that if you don\'t want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100\% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select \'OOP-Guild\'.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

1972,'(reference line trimmed)    Well, I\'d say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn\'t the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by reasonable?  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let\'s look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let\'s suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don\'t like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn\'t totally applicable to your problem, but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested murderer in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn\'t really a problem.',64,52,57,54,1909,0.0,69,0,0,27.666666666666668,57,0,0,0,Atheism

577,' Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused objective morality to look very relative.  After all, that was the point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\'s viewpoint:  If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an objective morality for us. That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or detrimental to) the creature He created.   \tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in \tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared \tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.  However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees of the Bible,) God\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a person\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\'s objective morality for us.   Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules. Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\'t comfortable with the subjectivity of principles.   \tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference \tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in \tverses 21-22:  You have heard that the ancients were told, \t\'You shall not commit murder\'...and \'Whoever commits murder shall \tbe liable to the court.\'  But I say to you that everyone who is \tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...  The objective morality of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to seeking God\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\'s objective morality for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he was/is (and that\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS objective morality. ',81,66,70,77,2657,0.0,114,8,0,23.30701754385965,0,0,0,79,Religion

1870,'   There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it\'s too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can\'t extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn\'t expelled     is the part that\'s nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  ',36,41,44,36,1163,0.0,49,3,0,23.73469387755102,0,0,46,0,Space
139,' Wishful thinking mostly. It\'s more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

85,'    _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely    no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have    to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to    conventional Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching    by comets, it\'s got too many holes in it to count, but at    least it was a good try...  So you have a plausible model for GRB\'s at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models.  A paper on the possibility of GRB\'s in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line    get 9304001   Here is the abstract of that paper.     The currently favored explanation for the origin of GRBs puts them    at cosmological distances;    but as long as there is no distance    indicator to these events all possible sources which are    isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is    why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,    although there is no known mechanism for generating GRBs    from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that GRBs    originate in the solar cometary cloud    cannot be excluded until it is disproved.     We use the available data on the distribution of GRBs (the BATSE    catalogue up to March, 1992), and    the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to    investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations    between the angular distributions of GRBs and comets\' aphelia,    assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,    at least to some extent, true variations    in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $ov$    test to both distributions.',53,57,60,49,1950,0.0,50,15,1,39.0,0,0,81,0,Space

1127,' Then we all live happily ever after. :-)  Seriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we\'re in, I suspect we\'d all agree on the best course of action.  Unfortunately, I have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise.   Some of us think there\'s a big God in the sky, some don\'t.  Some think they\'ve been chosen by God, others disagree.  Some think they are infallible, others think otherwise.  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out, there\'s little hope of everyone agreeing.   Yes.  I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that there\'s a frame of reference in which gassing six million Jews is good.  So that\'s probably about as close to an objective moral value as I\'ve encountered in my life so far.   Well, I think your example\'s poor.  If the bomb\'s in Iraq, for example, and was dropped by an American plane, many people would hold that it was a moral act.   Hmm.  So these moral values have a perceptible physical presence?   Right, and the chain ends right there.  The buck stops with me.  It\'s not an infinite regress.   Right.  The key point, however, is that there are vanishingly few of these moral issues where we can get 99.9\% of people to agree on the outcome for all frames of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)   I can\'t manage either.  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a terrorist act, but I have to admit that I couldn\'t exactly condemn it.  Although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight...   I think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have been better than peace.  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people killed.  Assuming it was successful terrorism, of course. ',51,45,50,46,1763,0.0,83,3,0,21.240963855421686,0,0,0,42,Religion

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\'s rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).  I\'ve run into two problems; I\'m sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the jaggies.  I\'m now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\'t have to change size as they move about in the room).  I\'ve decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the context of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.  Thanks in advance for any help.

1993,'  But you haven\'t taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at least some were able to tolerate it.  You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy.   Well, they haven\'t managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics, etc., but imagine what they\'d have to do to stop atheism.   So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, I\'d be glad if it were gone to.  I\'ve never supported it.  However, I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).   Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say, but I don\'t think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven\'t and don\'t do so.   Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can\'t say that these people (just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their faiths.   Well, I\'d really like to, and I\'ve tried, but I really don\'t know where to get access to _Congressional Records_ from the 1950\'s.  Can anyone help out here?   Only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.    So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?  Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.   That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included all atheists, in general, as well.  I don\'t think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That\'s silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don\'t advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency.   Well, mottos in general don\'t really have purposes...  I don\'t think it should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences.   Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.   Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.   But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don\'t you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?  [...]  What?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein said about relativity is worthy?  I mean, if Einstein said it, there\'s a good chance that it was right (at least at the time).   You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.   No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment.  And, in order for the Court to rule on something, a case usually must be presented.   Yes, some mushrooms can be planted.  And, I don\'t appreciate mushrooms on my pizza, either.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.

1495,' This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals: --------------------------------------------------- First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.  Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face\'s orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.  (Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.
