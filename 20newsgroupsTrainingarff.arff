3,'I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate respond to the Charley Challenges (and judging from my e-mail, there appear to be quite a few of you.)    It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2.

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group \'related\' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated.  If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.  And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

23,'There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.  This doesn\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes happens that someone says My grandson is the cutest baby! and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says Oh!  Isn\'t she the cutest thing!?  This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me, it is not.   Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from John E King:   No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that.  You would read I will make you a bare rock and You will never be rebuilt, and you\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way to get from `fishing nets\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large population\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.  In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal reading, they could read this passage and conclude medium-size city.  You seem to feel that Never be rebuilt means be rebuilt -- maybe so, but it is hardly a `clear implication\'.     Well, no.  That\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\'m from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but it\'s at least a two-horse town.  But supposing 22,000 people is a small town -- it\'s still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted.   And you\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.  Let\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26. Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.  Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.   *  This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.  For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some clear implications out of hat.  When Ezekiel said that N. would demolish your towers, that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea, that clearly implied that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N. would build a ramp up to your walls, that clearly implies that N. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls.  See?  A few clear implications that are totally contrary to the text, and you can reconcile anything you want. ',3
24,'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.  \tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively \tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume \tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not \texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable \tmeasure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment \tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two \ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw \tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is \talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge \tcolored with a special edge color  \tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.',1

1291,'Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues  in his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians.  Unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is  not available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable  result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such  as humanity.   Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the  responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience,  from writing a more considered response and fully entering the fray, as it were.   Let me then say what I can, briefly.  -----   This point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is pursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy.   This is a theological statement worthy of Barth. Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)   This requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among them. I wouldn\'t make that assumption; I don\'t think it is a reasonable assumption.    Michael, and I, and others, read \'the Bible\' with Christian glasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the NT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some points in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly  abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin\'s point with adequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew, and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )  This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:  mls> I am a radical Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Russell Turpin\'s \'No\' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate. Michael\'s self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal,  which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are  possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton was a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis was a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?  mls> ... Why don\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me mls> tell you something about Christianity? ...  Michael\'s question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) ) Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael\'s theological positions, actually) didn\'t tell him much about Christianity; Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): \'What do you mean?\' More direct, perhaps, would have been: \'What could you possibly mean?\' The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the  tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea of the tradition doesn\'t include him, Change your idea of the tradition!   How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue? I\'m on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael) on this issue, yet \'*nothing*\' is a hideous overstatement.  One verse is enough to refute it; I\'ll offer two, from Paul (of all people):  \'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...\'(Galatians 3:28 {I don\'t quote single verses as a rule, and I don\'t carry  them in my head}) and \'*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...\'  (roughly, from Romans).

33,'Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...  I\'m the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not even SGI\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

39,'  How could this possibly be environmental vandalism when there is no environment to vandalize up there?  Since the advertising is just to help defray costs, it\'s certainly no surprise that the taxpayers would bear most of the expense.  Sounds like a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the expense if they didn\'t do the advertising.   Great idea, they should have done it long ago.   I can\'t believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day, but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it\'s in LEO, so it would only be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time as it goes zipping across the sky.   No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so it would be no surprise.   Well, look on the, er, bright side.

41,' Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a standby mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat\'s explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.',2
42,'My turn to jump in! :)   I think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics. Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people\'s life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry, I don\'t deal as much in fiction, as I do in reality.

46,'     From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type, so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in The Australian Muslim Times, the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don\'t deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim.  In general, anyone who calls themselves a Muslim and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term Muslim is to be contrasted with Mu\'min, which means true believer.  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a true believer or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say Muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu\'min, or true believer in Islam.',0
47,' I will clarify my earlier quote.  God\'s laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you\'ll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today\'s world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it\'s a lifestyle that changes one\'s perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God\'s will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  God be with you,',3

Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.

The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.

67,' And that, of course, is the point.   You can\'t simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone\'s suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.

82,'Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4                         Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, It is raining or Today is Tuesday.  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of deny, not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So God exists and There exists a God both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as because, since, obviously and so on.  (The phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn\'t seem obvious to you, don\'t be afraid to question it.  You can always say Oh, yes, you\'re right, it is obvious when you\'ve heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore.  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore, it follows that, we conclude and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God.  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\'ll come to those later.)  Another example:  God created you; therefore do your duty to God.  The phrase do your duty to God is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form A because B.  If we\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start. -- This is an argument.  My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument\'s premises are false.  If the argument\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a truth table for implication.  The symbol => denotes implication; A is the premise, B the conclusion.  T and F represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as might makes right.  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: ... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man.  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\'s testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent\'s particular circumstances.  For example: It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent\'s argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You\'re white.  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\'s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as poisoning the well.  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance.  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.  Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\'t find me guilty; I\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.  The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services\' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  Have you stopped beating your wife?  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  Where did you hide the money you stole?  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue? or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  We should not speak ILL of our friends and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight.  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.  A IS BASED ON B FALLACIES / IS A TYPE OF FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: Isn\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\'t the Bible also a form of history?  Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\'t Islam a form of Christianity?  Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\'t dogs a form of cat?  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true.  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false.  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false, where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form If A then B, therefore if B then A.  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because that\'s the way it\'s always been.  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the black and white fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone\'s attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\'s position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.  Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King.  Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous you too fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  You\'re just being randomly abusive. So?  You\'ve been abusive too.',0
83,'     Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III, Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse?    Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what the Bible says.      Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses, once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King  Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself. Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself I am.   While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God. What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness\'s testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.    Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  I am.  He has revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58). Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.',3

If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally  reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as  Fokker\'s, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh  ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.  But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to  realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

87,'Sterrenkundig symposium \'Compacte Objecten\'                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun \'oervader\' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten \'compacte objecten\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I, Universiteit Utrecht.

88,' Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives, where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each other.  But I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example of a case where religion is not helping, instead it is used as a weapon against other humans. And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side, it looks like the Serbs are the oppressors, willing to use even Christianity as a weapon against their former friends.  Cheers, Kent',0

100,' This is a good point, but I think average people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesn\'t hurt anybody...    These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let\'s make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like ...let him be, as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace. or something like that.  (Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY at peace, there would be no need for inflicting evangelism)   Well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School, I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since I\'ve been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.

I don\'t know what a low grade fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo\'s claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\'t content with being assured that titanium (at .5\% in the Earth\'s crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; high-Ti basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14\% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3\% TiO2, frequently have 4\%, and sometimes even 5\% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1\% of the basalts are 5\% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).',2
106,' Could it be Public Missile, Inc in Michigan?  From the description of ad here, it sounds like they\'re talking about High Power Rocketry, an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this blanket waiver. There is also a High Power Safety Code which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and safe flight at a total impulse level.  For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup.',2

119,'[why do babies get diseases, etc.]   Here\'s the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we\'ve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) \'started off\' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I\'m really curious as to what you mean by \'the degeneration of the genetic code\'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I\'m sure you\'ll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\'t do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants \'overgrazed\', (forgive the poor terminology, I\'m an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who\'s making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here\'s another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by \'perfect\' in the phrase, \'created... perfect and without flaw\'? To my mind, a \'perfect\' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A \'perfect\' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer\'s glue? That is, the original genetic \'instructions\' were perfect, but were \'written\' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn\'t any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I\'m aware of.) But, I couldn\'t help making a few nitpicks here and there. :->  Sincerely,',0
1266,'Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director                                   GALILEO                      MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT                                POST-LAUNCH                            April 23 - 29, 1993  SPACECRAFT  1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43 (Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results  indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.  2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received properly.  3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).  4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.  6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28. The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.       After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink, a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence.  7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees, back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 203 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).  2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  \tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU) \tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU) \tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour \tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km \tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds  SPECIAL TOPIC',2

123,'I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in the back.  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention. It was from a company name Personal Missle, Inc. or something like that.  Anyhow, the ad stated that they\'d sell rockets that were up to 20\' in length and engines of sizes F to M.  They also said that some rockets will reach 50,000 feet.  Now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one of these beasts, isn\'t this illegal?  I can\'t imagine the FAA allowing people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.  And no, I\'m not going to even think of buying one.  I\'m not that crazy.   -Paul mine\'ll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite Dokas',2

127,'-*----  The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural assumptions that are independent of these rules.    The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if he has ultimate responsibility. Indeed, many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility. Once again, we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.    And who is to say that this interpretation is twisted?  There are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way. Michael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments to show that such readings are twisted, because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the base claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians, Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions that these conservative Christians will reject.     But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems. The meaning of these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition, or from some combination of these things.  These commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments.    Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many* parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are straightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline epistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior, the problem is *not* a lack of raw material.   -*----  No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel  seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel.   In a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve as the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the nature of the Christian god and about what men should and shouldn\'t do.   The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extra-Christian principles through which Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply the *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to their cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that make Michael\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by Christian interpretation.    Michael paints a picture of standard American atheism as the rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian interpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and the nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I think we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the lukewarm we should spit out. ',3

Bussard, Journal of \tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990  \t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion \t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the \t    thrust-power gain G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values \t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are \t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, high-thrust \t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system \t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local \t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 \t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer \t    high-thrust flight capability. One performance example shows a \t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with \t    19\% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows \t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in \t    Earth/moon space.  \tThe QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for \tAerospace Flight Propulsion by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion \tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.  \t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron \t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times \t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma \t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds \t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities \t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and \t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm \t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure \t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically \t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power \t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens \t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the \t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages \t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I \t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob \t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently \t    declared Koloc\'s PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one \t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather \t    than Tokamak.

138,'Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):  There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here\'s some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn\'s rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus\' orbit.  Because the Sun\'s size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it\'s unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that\'s looking for something   to do?  I\'d be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it\'s not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you\'ll need a big telescope that\'s a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don\'t   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it\'s only a 1.2 m.  jay',2

140,'  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of higher truth is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither higher or  lower; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one\'s discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God\'s creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.',3

144,'Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression R-dot-bar sub n (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun\'s energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a dead world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a dead planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers\' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\'s liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first \t     craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was \t     also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images \t     from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 \t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were \t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil \t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in \t      1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\'s \t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished \t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in \t      1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions \t       lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with \t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in \t       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. \t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe \t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending \t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before \t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles \t       similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet \t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in \t       1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the \t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar \t       mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. \t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of \t\tplanet\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian \t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on \t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in \t     March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased \t     enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian \t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian \t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red \t     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander \t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to \t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in \t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. \t     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit \t     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\' largest \t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to \t       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did \t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week \t       before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley\'s Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\'s. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\'s radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\'s atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:  \tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km \tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km \tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) \tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\'s     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

151,'Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:   (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize precisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it\'s a compressed format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header.   (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF?

They still arm themselves to defend the #>faith, and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a #>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives #>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their #>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking. #                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^  By they, you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of accusations were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: illegal activities. Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of underage wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\'m led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we\'re talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only crime was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the Smith phenomenon away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\'s testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\'t of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  The rest were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\'s vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful heirs were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This Rekhabite principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of do-it-yourselfers stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the 1-year food stockpile doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a sect???  It didn\'t splinter from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.  #>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very #>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\'re pledged to defend #>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.

I am not comfortable with this alleged cosiness with Mammon: I assure you that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that\'s why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship *how*, *where*, or *what* they may.  #        If it\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the salt of the Earth and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\'s orders (the late president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX Peace Keeper missile maze in Utah).  #        That\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have #splinter groups that don\'t mirror the masses, but these are small #and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry. # #        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

160,'Forwarded from: PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PASADENA, CALIF. 91109. (818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth\'s ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways, said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite, he continued.  The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements, Margitan explained, and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\'s Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        ',2

166,'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer.   I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter O there are two outlines:  \t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font) \t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes. The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:  \t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple \t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for \t\tsome fancy fonts). \t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you. And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone. Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with  whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.    Jesus uses the word men.  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out. Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian  is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian  can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven\'t seen Jesus\'s light, your evil deeds simply haven\'t been exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn\'t even know existed.   So do you see Jesus\'s point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus\'s perspective.  Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth, which do you choose?   And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light,  who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death.   And Kent, don\'t you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him. David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn\'t even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.  Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David Koresh wasn\'t anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago.    So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your mother\'s name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start.  The wouldn\'t have followed Koresh. They wouldn\'t have died.  But look what happened.  Their ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot.  Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?   Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded,  was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus\'s case, Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It didn\'t work with Jesus.    Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate? Who was Koresh\'s teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None  of them had an excuse.  ',3

171,'The primary problem in human nature is a fragmentation of being. Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\'s rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called theosis, or deification.  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.',3
172,' I haven\'t seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)  was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven\'t heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the  successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in  Russia. I\'m sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue  their development.   The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so that\'s a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don\'t know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB\'s probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?    They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. ',2

Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.  \t\t    Image Analysis & Processing  \tFor image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.  \t\t    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis  \tSphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.  \t\t    Easy External Program Interfacing  \tSphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.  \t\t    Quick Quality Presentation  \tSphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx\'s 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers. \tOther Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?  \t\t    Software Support & Development  \t Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d\'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.  \t\t    Performance Tested   \tCNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.

Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don\'t make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.   (Deletion)   That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible, nothing less.',0

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.',2

217,'ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!    This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe orbital motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth\'s surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = dark matter)    The earth isn\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun\'s image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its foot print being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\'s ether field, which is  itself in the sun\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars\' images being dragged around by the sun\'s ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and distance  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the path is not the same. The moon\'s lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as earth\'s shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /                      M    |      |      OR                M               _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating turntable view  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\'ve seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that earth shadow.) Its only the moon\'s image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    Light-Years between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The piece of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\'d  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I\'d start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine\'s receiver next to it.      If you don\'t think you\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\'m curios to see what  they did and ate. Don\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept \'immortal\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  advising them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn\'t remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there\'s more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he\'s here, its just that that is work, and with  every \'adjustment\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30\% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10\% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2\% GNP?, construction 6\% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, its chaos! They  said, no, its order. He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and \'vanishing\' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and  pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren\'t eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a  huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The  troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill  each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)    Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot  tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they  suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that  they aren\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.     Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women  and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut  from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think  that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as  mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples  of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.    That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He  tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which  the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\'ll  play a poker face up until he thinks he\'s cornered, and then he\'ll  whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\'re willing to  live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was  right, and he didn\'t over play his hand, and he won\'t need to go  back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over  your destiny, just don\'t live along a path that leads to a reality  in which you don\'t want to be a part of. ',2
218,'  Ah, now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario.   We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your own words) \'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck, makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years\'.)  Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.   Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly nothing to this \'revelation\' thing?    Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?   Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.  Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake?   Sincerely,   Ray Ingles               ingles@engin.umich.edu',0

224,'    Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10\% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a \'disk\' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical \'halo\' population).  We don\'t see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren\'t concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don\'t see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in. ',2

229,'  I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read?  Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian scientists would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have died for a lie.  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the real thing.    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a Therefore...   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b.       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).

235,'  I think the passage you\'re looking for is the following.  Matthew 5:17    Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus\' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn\'t apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\'s apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it\'s an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul\'s comments are not the world\'s clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it\'s important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it\'s not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that\'s not Jesus\' approach.  Jesus\' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law, such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he\'s looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.',3

252,' [...stuff deleted...]  Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were  each using the terms fact and theory.  I\'ll only add that I think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them, though your usage is quite valid.   I\'ll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or  describes things we can observe.  Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don\'t just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory_.  I\'m asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_, basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a  clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.  I\'m not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not  the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered  fact (as you would say).  There aren\'t really little planetary particle  systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original  point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only  the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It\'s enough to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I\'m not sure I am being  any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.  The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:     1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)       --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational         evidence (your way)     2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it         a theory then he can.  I won\'t:  it has no supporting evidence  \tand it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can         be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn\'t \tmuch to say.  Do you agree? ',3

Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality.  If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden, she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung. And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of. It\'s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity.

As it is now, we don\'t see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only responsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us feel responsible without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to feel like good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give me the freedom to say I\'m good, and the rest of the world can burn.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency\'s establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA\'s remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications.

Not necessarily, Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive, for instance.   As far as I know, the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts.       Yep, but it will take another day or so to get the source. I hope your German is good enough. :-)       I still do not see how copies from 200 allow to change the dating of John.       Yes, but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence. The authencity of many letters is still discussed. It looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well.

I will argue that your latter statement, I believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that no gods exist (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don\'t   know and therefore don\'t believe in them and don\'t NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even  after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to faith and existence. I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\'s rather pointless to debate the so called existence of God - and that is not what I\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that god does not exist, I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it\'s \'usual sense\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of God.   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one\'s promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion based upon observation, I will have to ask what observtions are you refering to? There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes  partents believe in God also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the existence or non-existence of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say I believe that God   does/does not exist. Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the existence of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use Him because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use She go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\'ll be  glad to.)     And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I\'ve misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think  I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. I\'m interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.         ',0

274,'I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek Lexicon renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed chorion.   Now I\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:  \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Louw and Nida \tRobinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Grimm \tWord study Concordance, Tynsdale \tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  \t early Christian Writings, Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon, Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:  \tA space, place, region, district, field, area, country place,  \tland, farm, estate, a bit of tillage, and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about grave. As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer\'s investigations into contradictions to  be once again, as your friend said it, lacking in substance, and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer\'s contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\'s) is the definition of agros, the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word agros is defined as a field in the country. Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for field in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for field in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the Potter\'s Field.   \t\t\t\tLater,  \t\t\t\tDave Butler',3

285,'In the April edition of One Small Step for a Space Activist, Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:   Another problem is what are called \'wraps\' (or sometimes    the \'center tax\'). When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10    billion won\'t be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\'t), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term \'center tax\'. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesn\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\'t post a response immediately, I do have a real job I\'m supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of \'center tax\', or \'wrap\' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \'tax\' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center \'taxes\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8\%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8\% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don\'t if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don\'t have the numbers in front of me, but I\'d guess at least 95\% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it\'s only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question What is the government doing with SSF funds that don\'t go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren\'t eaten up by the center tax?)  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my \'home\' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the \'tax\' does not all go into a \'slush fund.\' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the \'general\' services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn\'t go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is \'billable\' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? Talk about a burecratic nightmare!',2

1311,' I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they would have HAD to land with HST in the bay.   Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.   I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do.  I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought  down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting, cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment  mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second  time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a  few years as gyros and other components wear out.

Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\'s ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

323,'Printer model and specification:  Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)   Hello,  We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer.  We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The  copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript  with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98  rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that  acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript.  We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality  pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a  warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work.   Here my questions:  If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or  parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?  Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer?   The Big question:  Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?    Please email directly to me, I don\'t not read news on a regular basis.  I will post a summary.  Thanks in advance. ',1

I realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic, but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything, and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience?  What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god.    But all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been punished with death.  We aren\'t punished with sin now, of course, because God has changed.  He required a brutal, sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.     Yet he does so now.  He has changed.  The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins.  Besides, his midst is everywhere, so your statement is meaningless. He tolerates sin in Hell, which surely is in his midst as well.  Also, given that he is all-knowing, he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins, as well as when and where, so what does tolerance have to do with anything.  All of this is absolute nonsense, unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, or unless he doesn\'t take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim.   Not relevant.  The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your god.  The nature of his creations/victims is not at issue.   I see: an all-knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be, and an all-powerful god who had no choice in the matter. Mindmush.   Did I miss something?  Did you give some indication at to why a KIND and LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation?

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in any Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word Rosicrucian in the  name of the organization. I only claim having done some homework :-)       This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different, it\'s my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck, English may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)       I proceed:      Let\'s start with the name Rosicrucian. I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a rosicrucian body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some \'rosicrucians\' you mean members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian. At least that is what your observation suggests :-)       I\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, most members does not *necessarily* mean best.       Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they descend (at least in part) from what was the Gold-und-Rosenkreuz (Golden and Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two Golden and Rosy Cross, the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with Masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).       You\'ll have to trust me when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you\'d probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO.        Again, instead of R:s, it should be Lectorium Rosicrucianum :-). It is curious to know that 3 other RC \'orders\' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*.       The Cathars were a \'heretic\' christian sect that directly challenged the \'authority\' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the 12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church\'s unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern Italy, then throughout the south of France.

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days.  As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.',2

And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at  all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?

Seriously, though, you\'re never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious limitation.

353,' The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate  onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh  envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You\'ve hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don\'t know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM\'s I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don\'t have the ullage problem that cryo\'s  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia.

[....]  Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \'hacker\' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.  I, on the other hand, know what \'hacker\' means from those who consider themselves such.  Following is the definition from Jargon File 2.9.10. (This is also known as the Hackers Dictionary.)  The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:     :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.      1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most      users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who      programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A      person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is      good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,      or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \'a UNIX      hacker\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who      fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One      might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \'password      hacker\', \'network hacker\'.  See {cracker}.       The term \'hacker\' also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net (see {network, the} and      {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see      {hacker ethic, the}).       It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an      elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new      members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if      you claim to be one and are not, you\'ll quickly be labeled      {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.     :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing      is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun      and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits      no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.       Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no      means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that      *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary      control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}      project.       Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.      But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as `benign\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On      this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,      preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an      unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.       The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing      resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as      {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})      can function without central control because of this trait; they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdom\'s most valuable intangible asset.  :  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is :  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate... :-)  Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \'hacker\'.  So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace.  (This means that \'hacker\' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.  : >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\'t work that way. :  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)  Language works anyway that we want it to work.

372,' I\'m not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because I\'ve seen it drive - I\'ve done more than at in fact - I\'ve actually driven it. (now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what\'s out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don\'t believe it\'s entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  pink unicorns don\'t exist because I haven\'t seen them, this conclusion has it\'s foundation in observation and theory. A pink unicorn, if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven\'t defined God as existence - in fact, I haven\'t defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it\'s relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I\'m saying. I\'m making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I\'m not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have evidence or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don\'t follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn\'t know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that God does not exist. Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \'god is\' is meaningful at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith.

387,'    Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)       Sean, I don\'t want to get into a \'mini-war\' by what I am going to say, but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris, you\'ll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve those for c.s.m.a :-) )     I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn\'t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don\'t know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn\'t even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMind\'s Accelerator?)?     Don\'t misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.     But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in  my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

Now I know you\'ll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational people have problems with that logic?  But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.   ;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?    It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it\'s still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he had wrought.   First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?  One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don\'t want this, but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.  And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God. Can love as a truth be proven, logically?    John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course, I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically, you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant, Jesus, for instance.   I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective.

401,'     The problem is, your use of the word objective along with values. Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of worth is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase objective worth is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus objective) would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  good) is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. ',3

405,' The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\'s observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\'s system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, \'twere not so.  Mercury\'s perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\'s numbers rather than Leverrier\'s.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\'s fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.                       - G.

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.

That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.

421,' Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that).  But yes, you\'ve got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it\'s not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST\'s own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST\'s own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don\'t want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.',2

You seem to simply be saying that whatever *you* understand the Bible to say is orthodox.     You are obviously mistaken, since many, many people have read the Bible and many do not agree with you on this point.  Once again, Robert, is your interpretation the only correct or orthodox one?       This whole string began as a response to your attacks on Mormonism; no one is attacking your personal beliefs, only your tendency to present them as orthodoxy.  I don\'t much care *what* you believe about the Bible; just don\'t present you personal understanding as the only orthodox one.      I have never attacked your specific beliefs -- that\'s *your* approach, remember?     Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views is indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways, which has been my whole point all along.  The specifics of your belief are your business; just don\'t pretend that they are anything more than your personal intepretation, and be careful about crying heresy based on your private belief system.

424,'[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\'Dwyer)]         From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:   Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For instance, \'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering\' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as \'5 + 7 = 12\' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  \'One ought always to do the right thing\' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of \'self-evident truths\', but can he deny the subjectivist\'s claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.',0

426,'Hi! Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I\'d like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn\'t touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem sphere from 4 poits. Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).',1

431,'  No matter how absurd it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I think the important aspect is the result.  David.  --- On religion:',3

435,'  Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn\'t at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn\'t come to you because your god doesn\'t exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.   And in John 3:16:     For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.   You are included in whosoever.  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\'t be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God\'s church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: Satan would surely like to have you.  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked Why not believe in Zeus?  Zeus didn\'t offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus. ',3

Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you\'d remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It\'s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that\'s no worse than your own.  Let\'s see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn\'t, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn\'t.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  Net.ghod wannabe?  Naturally, Fred, you\'ve correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn\'t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you\'d bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn\'t clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I\'ll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I\'m stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you\'re happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don\'t have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick or Pat can approach your high standards, but I\'m dropping it now.  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \\ As the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.',2

463,'THE DIVINE MASTERS                              Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that            Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God            into the physical world, God Incarnate.                            But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of ETERNAL DAMNATION in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional feelings are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM or SOUND            CURRENT, (referred to as THE WORD in John 1:1-5, and as            The River of Life in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            silver cord.                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul\'s cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the SOUL PLANE, which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living Eck Master or Mahanta for the            Eckankar organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the Sant            Mat organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS, by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the Anti-Christ, which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called last days.  But the Masters            don\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book HERE AND HEREAFTER, by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50\% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the KING JAMES VERSION.  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person\'s PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               2nd COMINGS                 If a Divine Master physically dies (translates)            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (translates), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus\' 2nd Coming are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called Hades, and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian Heaven is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the SOUND            CURRENT (THE WORD, THE BANI, THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The SOUND CURRENT manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as SOUL TRAVEL)            REPLACE blind faith.

467,' The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn\'t hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That\'s war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\'m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\'d be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\'t understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\'s sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\'ve been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,',0

471,'In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed movies. They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale movie of Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.  I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many  other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don\'t know what kind of software/hardware was used for creating the movies I saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you put 11 minutes on one floppy disk?',1

Very slowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property. As for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it gets used. Two loops? That\'s not a design problem? Isolation from air and water? That doesn\'t cause design problems? In comparison BWR\'s a dream rides!   Don\'t get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder! More steel, more complexity.  Joseph Askew ',2
473,'  Because that would contradict your religious beliefs; therefore, you feel more comfortable simply accusing his sincerity, so you will not have to critically examine your religious beliefs. ',3
474,' Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920\'s.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know  what tainted evidence you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant tainted evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from  their footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence tainted, what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered shrewd guesses?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject boundaries...',3

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The floor is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in space.

The quote starts with material from p 78, and ends with material from page 81!  On page 78, there\'s the bit that says (the parts left out in John King\'s quote are marked by <>): <...> the doubt that has infiltrated the previous, smugly confident certitude of evolutionary biology<\'s last twenty years> has inflamed passions <and provoked some very interesting thought and research>.  Eldridge goes on immediately following the butchered quote: In short, evolutionary biology has entered a phase of creativity that is the hallmark of good, active science.  The material that is on page 81 that is quoted by John King has been butchered even more severely:  <I mention this only to illustrate the> **There is**[these words not in the original text-prl] lack of agreement even within warring camps <: things are really in uproar these days, and each of the basic ways of looking at evolutionary biology has its minor variants.> Sometimes it seems as if there are as many variations on each evolutionary theme as there are individual biologists.  Eldridge goes on: But that\'s the way it should be; this is how science is supposed to operate.   And just a few sentences down:  When they [creationists] misrepresent the exuberant, creative doubt and controversy permeating evolutionary biology these days, they are actively promoting scientific illiteracy.  And that, John E. King, is precisely what you have done with Eldridge\'s article. Are you personally responsible for the butchery of the text or have you pulled it out of some creationist propaganda?

485,' No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don\'t know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA\'s incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I\'m sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I\'ve got a background in astronomy, it\'s hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it\'s a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers. Commercial projects, however, generally don\'t get funding -- they get customers -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.  Nahh.

487,'Press Release No.19-93 Paris, 22 April 1993  Users of ESA\'s Olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments  Today Europe\'s space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s. This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.',2

While organics would become significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.

502,' I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some  references.  See Robin Lane Fox\'s _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where  Lane Fox writes, ... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus\'  career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.  In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21 April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine  Pagel\'s _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine].  Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.  So far as I can deduce, today\'s consensus is built on at least three things:  1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory.  I don\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed (does anyone?).  Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I  didn\'t elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to incorporate theology).  Can\'t say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before  Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one  hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any, because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is  certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have  the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic  ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.  :-)',3
503,' You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.   Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?   As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.  I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to  change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position.',2
504,'To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..    From the March 1993 Aero Vision (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the   McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude   of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational   settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social   studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available   either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything   needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.   Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-   7302.    By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is it an advertisement to buy the product.

505,' Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside, outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd, then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.  My experience tells the second method is relible.  Hope this helps.',1

516,' I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman\'s account of the software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn\'t had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.)',2

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     scooped by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttle\'s Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:         Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year \t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year \t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year      The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25\% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would     be decreased by 0.0065\%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1\% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *don\'t* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly the bends, certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     team\'s medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You can\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it can\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earth\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE FACE ON MARS      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\'t     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are  conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have  to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe  in objects or beings that haven\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at  God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan  except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond  hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\'t see them)  The   reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians  have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.

There is a big difference here, Stalin didn\'t say that he stood for a    particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and   then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least   an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this   viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because   one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the   russians that helped Stalin that weren\'t atheists - don\'t they contradict   your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant   to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists   can\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\'t support).      Ah, and here\'s another point you didn\'t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist  doesn\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\'t exist, he/she may  just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\'s the example:    Strong atheism - I believe god does not exist   a positive belief   Weak atheism   - I don\'t believe in a god       a negative belief    these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of  god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that  you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\'s look at it this way (in sets)    suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent  as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas  exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person  not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that  even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:    christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god    atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)    atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set    agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E\', ....)      Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not   will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always    prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival   trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.

532,'   >Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks    >for sounding rockets?     Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the    tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10\% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas  quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I\'ll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.

533,' One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man\'s Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.  It doesn\'t compare religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way.  ',0

535,'The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn\'t know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.',2
536,' I am not aware of any Turkish Caliphate viewpoint on this. Can you reference?  However, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:  Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one\'s wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.   We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse men\'s solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones.  (Quote from Mas\'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam,  p. 118).  I wouldn\'t consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM) viewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet\'s cousin and the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating  night with a woman.  Selim Guncer ',0
537,'Hi.  I\'m writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I\'ve written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.

Its easy enough to convert, but if I don\'t know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn\'t handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.

Then, actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.

552,'    Nick Haines sez;    >(given that I\'ve heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in    >maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).     Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I\'ve never    heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process\' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process\', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical    basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will    take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will    be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project    management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects    are planned in detail, and there is software configuration    management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is    consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a    rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,    and typically a `software engineering process group\' within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts    are effective and certified.',2
553,'Archive-name: space/acronyms Edition: 8  Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle: Edition 8, 1992 Dec 7 Last posted: 1992 Aug 27  This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\'s an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I\'ll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\'re on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they\'re introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\'re simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who\'s sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

555,' OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\'85-\'89), the PI (\'88-\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\'s - \'86-\'90), the Power Series parallel systems (\'88-\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths, faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we don\'t, we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\'t wait to buy, but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If that\'s happening, it\'s becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don\'t give up, we know it.  Josh   |:-)  --  ',1

557,'Dear Rob,   Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\'ll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn\'t see it.   Here\'s is how I see the dialog:   Me:  Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.   BK:  There is no truck.  Me:  Turn around at look.  BK:  No.  Me:  Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.  BK:  No. Explain to me why trucks exist.  Me:  Turn around or you will run over.  BK:  No. I won\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.  Me:  You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.       And by the way, I really have an open mind.   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. ',3
558,' #I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the #ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,  I don\'t like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try: \txwdtopnm <xwdfile> |\t# convert to PPM \t[ppmtopgm |]\t\t# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print \tpnmtops -noturn |\t# .. to PostScript \tlpr\t\t\t# print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4 wide, use: \tpnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it \tis high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a \twidth less than 4, and will thus be printed smaller than 4 wide. \tIf you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4, and \twill be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified \tpaper width.  \tIn short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size, \tbut it will not blow it up automatically.

564,'  (Deletion)   Yes, sorry. I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can\'t becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can\'t it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.',0

566,' Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade  MAGI:   [Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting  ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous  _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which  most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the  second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of  the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi  to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]    The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain  etymology. It may originally have meant member of the tribe, as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish (hostile to a member of the tribe). This meaning would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to member of the priestly tribe and perhaps to priest (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the Magoi as one of the six tribes of the Medes.   For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.   The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.   There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, gift), is not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found, in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of purity, or separation of the mixture of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as chorus, from the root mangh, which is said to mean sing the magic song (Nyberg, 1966) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for priest, athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is  perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis  (Gershevitch, 1964).   The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in particular derives from an older form, magupati (head of the Magi). During the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (the high priest of high priests) came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.   The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it. The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples of Central Asia.   The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful, or Ahrimanical, animals (khrafstra) such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants, tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was that of the priesthood: white.   In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes and thus the cult of the gods. Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and master of himself.   During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media, in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.   No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek, like goes, expert in the magic arts (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.   To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.   The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism, belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name.   Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, the law-abjuring daivas), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.; Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own priesthood, would be very strange.   The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (beneficent spirit) and Angra Mainyu (hostile spirit) but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]   Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\'s treachings, as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).   Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]   The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce, 1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.',3

April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64          Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give full consideration to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.          NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.',2

585,'I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.  In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent ex-gay ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as ineffective . . . not one person was healed.  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed reparative therapy.  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called The Ex-Ex-Gay by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is physically forced to stay in this reparative therapy but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\';t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some first-hand real life and loving understanding.  God\'s love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant.',3

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it\'s faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

607,' First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell., which seems to be the usual religious post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won\'t get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an objective morality.  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You\'re defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won\'t stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it\'s immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don\'t know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                             \t(Evidence deleted)  I\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept The Word of God that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.

One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or more good than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word penis?

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1)\tWhy did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2)\tWhy did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.  Later, \t\t\t\t\t\tJeff                                    ',3

Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?  I think you\'re the one under the rock, and I\'m getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the long hike, but it\'s well worth it!   Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They\'re as much different as your god is from them...  Don\'t you see?  I\'m not going to accept ANYTHING that I can\'t witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not something as mega-powerful as what you\'re trying to get me to accept. Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good *reason* to, don\'t you?   When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.   Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you\'re proud of it.  You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven\'t, then how can you say you have an open mind?   Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you\'ve led as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you\'ve led a good life.   Please do.   I\'m sorry, I don\'t feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I\'d worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in which case it\'s not really all that important.  Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you\'re right.

627,' Superficially a good answer, but it isn\'t that simple.  An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\'ve got.  Perhaps it\'s more accurate to say that there\'s a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed Pro-Life movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don\'t believe this to be the case. ',3

A problem with such statements is that one can\'t disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all.

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here\'s a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called PEX.  PEXlib is a slightly lower level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of policy - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you\'re working strictly in X and don\'t care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API\'s have a lot in common.',1

641,'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\'s LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\'d post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the Space Age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, What\'s New - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\'s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our mind children - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America\'s Space Age won\'t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\'s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\'s technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......',2

645,'  At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we\'re continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists believe in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I\'m trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I\'m a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).',0

668,'  Well, I\'ve provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc.  I don\'t think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  I\'ll have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I don\'t claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn\'t harmful, although it isn\'t helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don\'t you mean bisexuality?   This is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.  The we forms are used throughout.   That\'s right.  The goals themselves aren\'t inherent.   You could, but such would contradict observations.   But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be true.  I don\'t think your postulate would be valid.   Yes, and I think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  You think they don\'t?  Or are they not good goals?',0

677,'Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a \'fast\' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user\'s    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user\'s    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don\'t need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for \tfaster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn\'t support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can\'t, but because    I don\'t have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That\'s all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I\'ve provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!

I recognize that there are some moral systems around which don\'t accept this; I reject them as dangerous and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist xtianity--no, that\'s not a slam).

683,'frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\'Dwyer) writes ...  While I\'ll agree that these are generally held to be good things, I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally good or bad.  And when I referred to the truth I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one\'s morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one\'s own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. ',0

685,' It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn\'t be pushed any further.  I\'d say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.   Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available, but that shouldn\'t last too long, and doesn\'t seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus\'s at the end of some (all?) quarters, but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren\'t what they need, I\'m sure, but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)   They don\'t get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.  We can\'t design systems that meet just their needs, or we won\'t sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we don\'t have some niche products, like Reality Engine).   But surely you don\'t expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?

This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize scroll and zoom;                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.        One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the        controller by reprogramming it.                 IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100 ',1
696,'  Exactly. Some of the SPACE:1999 effects remain first-rate even today.     Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying Into Infinity. This was a one-off thing done as part of BBC\'s educational SF series The Day After Tomorrow. The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of reaching the speed of light (lightship Altares), the four-man crew eventually  journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I think). I saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but then again I was a fan of SPACE:1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in those days:-) --- Does anyone know if Into Infinity has been released on video?

699,'  Again, you missed Jesus\'s point.  If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by life in the world.

Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding material?  Why do you such with the Bible?

For  eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that eternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship with God.    If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of hell in Luke 16:19-31.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

708,'NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President\'s new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give full consideration to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.',2

727,'          Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.  This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.  ',1
728,' Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your proof is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would prove nothing.  Scholars speak of the weight of evidence.  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\'t a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels prove your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to prove your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying I am right because I say so.    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where fundamentalist came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe inerrant broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don\'t foist it on others.   Regards,',3

732,'Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I\'m not certain I\'m solving it in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point me in the right place to look...  We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube\'s axis:                                                            |                                      ||                   [ image                                                           |   X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen                             metallic || tube              |                                      ||                   |                                                           |  We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.  We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object\'s hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse\'s axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?  We\'d appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.  Thanks in advance, Simon.',1
733,'              Sure. Yes, I did. You see I don\'t think that rape and murder should be dealt with lightly.

My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement that sex is not the business of religion (one of your arguments).  The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to find a marriage partner.  ',0

746,'In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)   I regard love as no more or less benign than any other Christian does. You are merely expressing approval of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  Love is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the gentle words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one\'s own notion of sin on another, and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism, Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) God in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The possibility that always exists is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade Christian B of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:  \tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved \t    in the Inquisition.  \tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however \t    painful this *seems*, discipline her children for their \t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or \t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example \t    deterring others from the same loss-of-soul.)  \tA.  I point out that this justification of a failure in love \t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of \t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.  \tB.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with cultural baggage.  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\'s B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, one possibility fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the persuasion will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have accepted that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against heresy, it is *bound* to break down in precisely the worst cases.  The conservative (I don\'t think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is justified in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a greater good.  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one\'s theories about sin entitled one to cast aside Jesus\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a radical Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the base commandments is that they *aren\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one\'s actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  Conservatives may twist this act as if you were God to mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\'t keep YOUR rules. They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation against God by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the conservatives have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* ethical systems (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of commandments -- so little that the Christians who desperately *want* commandments go mining for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another.  \t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson \t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that \t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\'ll \t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why \t there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved.]  You are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]',3

766,' : The Bible says there is a God; if that is true then our atheism is : mistaken.  What of it?  Seems pretty obvious to me.  Socrates said : there were many gods; if that is true then your monotheism (and our : atheism) is mistaken, even if Socrates never existed.   Jim,  I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt\'s questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history, then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of atheism.',0

768,'[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word on faith, we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn\'t require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don\'t believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.',0
769,'I\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It\'s not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I don\'t think I\'ll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example everybody can sell you everything.   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (can\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50\% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, they\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don\'t worry  because we\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won\'t worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25\% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware. ',2

779,' It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now, there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (x,y)\'s).  2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you        can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the        Reference(x,y).      b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where correct is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and you can\'t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.

784,'The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW as will be covered with this treatise.  MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW) is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture, Qur\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him) through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\'an by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW, is a treason against Islam, against Qur\'an, against the message of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah. He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\'an is from  Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:  \tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men, \tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal \tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of \tall things.  --------------------- Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The  Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers. Allah\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, for Allah has full knowledge of all things.  ---------------------- DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2  A   D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\'an  Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of  Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor  VOL 1, No 11, Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------    \t\t NINETEENTH LETTER    \t\t MU\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI  (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)         (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)     SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW) declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur\'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids)  sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars of Islam) to the hundreth degree.    The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the effect of the words,\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\'    Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by Him, \'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position.  \'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word \'Yes\' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word \'Yes.\'    In the same way, ALLAH\'s Most Noble Messenger claimed: \'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, \'No lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!\'    Although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways.    The Wise Our\'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. ',3

1345,'This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine. The first fully international issue has been published and echoes  are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si).   Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993  Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you  will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse.    A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology  (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question.    On the second page of each Number an editor\'s profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional  achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the  understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.    The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.

792,'I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn\'t pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn\'t see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn\'t care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\'s Real name)  she didn\'t raise David Koresh.  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here\'s another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the Justification part part of the plan.  That\'s when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered Cruel and Unusal Punishment to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\'s acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.                                                                 HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!  THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!  Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy! I hope he gets it.                               ',3

798,':  (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the   original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say no good because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People\'s magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be one who doesn\'t draw   exclusive circles -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around Mormon or Christian, to decide who is orthodox   and who isn\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ\'s orthodoxy is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    I recently spent some time in a Christian bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to Cults and the   Occult, and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (Perfect   love casteth out fear, I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the religious right wing has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\'t like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.   The above sermon was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled Christian, if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That\'s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church\' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.  Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion  and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.   ',3

My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.  What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  I\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but I\'m just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe it\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren\'t entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn\'t have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can\'t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to have hardware which will blow anything else away, while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as Bill and claims to be the MS-iah.  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of interpersonal computing which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.

820,'  You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book Orientalism by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read Orientalism by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn\'t too long).   I haven\'t read Lewis\'s article, so I can\'t comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read Orientalism by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title Islam and Women, reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur\'an and contains numerous Qur\'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says I am a Muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur\'an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by following the Qur\'an that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.',0

828,'Okay, I\'ll bite. I should probably leave this alone, but what the heck...   But didn\'t he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.   Well, I\'m no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the long knives. The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\'s SA circle.   Well, you\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\'t believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the knight of the long knives several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\'s homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\'ve  read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.    I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\'t you think they  would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving), then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?  I don\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\'s friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a  product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\'s homosexuality.  In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis,  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the evils of homosexuality. Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.  No, I don\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access  to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I don\'t have the time. Nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.',3

If I read you right, you\'re saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility.

Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It\'s not like they\'d be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It\'s a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it\'s good for pan-European cooperation.

840,'I\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\'t think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                   ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly            /  | /        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as        /                |          the graph wasn\'t up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can\'t tell us.  Read Aviation Leak.  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\'s reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\'t know about that aspect of the flight profile. ',2
841,'What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.  Libertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.',1

844,'  Oops, sorry, my words, not the words of the Qur\'an.   Note that (the celestial bodies) in the above verse is an interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator\'s  (incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.  Here is Maurice Bucaille\'s translation (he studied Arabic for his research into the Qur\'an and science) of this verse:  (God is) the One Who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon. Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion. (Qur\'an :33)  The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for a long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse (or anywhere in the Qur\'an).',0

847,'  Yes, and everyone thinks as you do.  No one thinks that he is going to cause or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high. Just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting blanks does not mean that you are less guilty.   You mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation?  And, you should note that that situation will never occur.  There are always other options thank killing.  Why don\'t you just say that all killing is wrong.  This is basically what you are saying.   Are you attempting to be condescending?   But, most people have found the risk to be acceptable.  You are probably much more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric blender, than you are to be executed as an innocent.  I personally think that the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk is acceptable.  Acceptable is the fudge factor necessary in such an approximation to the ideal.',0

It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were inserted (badly) by later editors.  As for the four gospels being in harmony on the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.   Acts 1:18: Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of  iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his  bowels gushed out.  Matt. 27:5-7: And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple,  and departed, and went and hanged himself.  And the chief priests...bought  with them the potter\'s field.   Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34  Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30   MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the  word  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.  MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.  LUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?  Verily,  verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me thrice.  JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.   (This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made!  Not the only time he does this either...)  MAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet,  saying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  zechariah 11:11-13 (nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)  What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?  scarlet - Matthew 27:28  purple John 19:2   Mark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was when the sentence was passed.   Matthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews Mark\t --  The King of the Jews Luke\t --  This is the king of the Jews John\t --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews   vinegar - Matthew 27:34  wine with myrrh - Mark 15:23   Matthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of James, and the mother of Zebedee\'s children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far off, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less. John says that Jesus\'s mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and Mary Magdalene.   Matt.27:46,50: And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,  saying, Eli, eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice, yielded u the ghost.  Luke23:46: And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, unto  thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.  John19:30: When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is  finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.   Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an earthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints.  John is the only one who mentions Jesus\'s side being peirced.   Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was supposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.  Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, and Mark 10:34 has after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again. As far as I can see from a quick look, the prophecies have after three days, but the post-resurrection narratives have on the third day.   Matthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it was dark.   MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother  of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.  JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it  was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.   MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.  MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on  the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.  LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and  the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.   Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes this claim.   Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told them, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only appearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples.  Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that they told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.  Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to Emmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally recognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem, they told the disciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them, frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them.  John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in Jeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce more Jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not recognised.  After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat together and converse.  The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of God: And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight.  And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood by them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven, shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven Acts 1:3-11  Paul outdoes every other authority by saying that Jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.   Matthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.  John says nothing about it.  Acts contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)   MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till all these things be done.  LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till all be fulfilled.  1 thessalonians 4:15-18  1 Corinthians 15:5 (12) Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12) Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection) MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  \tAnd Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. (2 Kings 2:11)  \tNo man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t... the Son of Man. (John 3:13)  As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses, you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right!  (In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error, the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.

850,'   When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving, communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity or parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government, however  they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.  We are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other than ours.   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.   I think it took more than one minute.',0

859,'I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned Tyre (1990-92). Here\'s the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright San Jose Mercury news):  ---   Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people and  wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon\'s mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.         The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.  Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road  outside Tyre in February 1988. -------------- ...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the places where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so there\'s a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned thousands of people entering and leaving this place).  I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will consider this place to be a fishing village :-).  Cheers, Kent ',3

How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug be from that of the Shuttle and it\'s OMS engines??????  I know that no small manuevering tug exists,  but maybe  one could soup up a Bus 1.   Does anyone out there have the de-clasified specs on hte BUS 1?  would it be able to provide enough  control force to balance the HST,  and  still have the rocket thrust to hurl her into a decent high orbit?

My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.     I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper better,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable space manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost. it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.',2

869,'   The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled- and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the \'30\'s, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn\'t require gov\'t to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice, some were gov\'t funded, some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.   I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop, and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can\'t give them.  We just don\'t know enough.  The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to start them, etc. ',2

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  \tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU) \tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU) \tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour \tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km \tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC',2

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\'ll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\'ll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it\'s stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you\'ve got the gumption... that\'s what they\'re here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.      \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site \t\t \tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite  \t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely anonymous FTP to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don\'t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you\'re in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... \tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines \tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\'ll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we\'ll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5 disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\'d just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you\'d send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this info-file there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the .rm file for     the image or series of images...or in the Artists directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn\'t explicitly given, then you\'ll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\'ll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it\'s always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in dos format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit code for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:   \tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you\'d like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That\'s about it for now.  More guidelines will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS    \t     (a sumerian deity) or it\'s followers, be they pope, priest, \t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations \t     however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original   \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.   \t     It\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone \t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.       \t     Unless you\'ve given permission for that, it\'s illegal.  OTIS \t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights \t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to  \t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed  \t     electronically.  If you don\'t want your images distributed      \t     all-over, don\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is \t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or \t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not  \t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,         \t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific \t     permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is stimulate.

875,'Most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which I am following up are dealt with in the following post I made on talk.abortion yesterday, modified to correct the next to last paragraph.  Message-ID: <nyikos.734890344@milo.math.scarolina.edu>  References: <nyikos.734360987@milo.math.scarolina.edu> <nyikos.734640769@milo.math.scarolina.edu> <1993Apr13.122356.3612@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>     Dean did not.  He called them the Great Commission but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus\'s words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:  \tAnd if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have \tto say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust \tfrom your feet.  Matt. 10:15:   \tI tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not   \tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with   \tthat town.   > The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  Actually, this comment of your\'s is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of instruction to spread the word.  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\'re just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you\'re still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn\'t take much sophistication to understand.  On top of which, I doubt that the answer is at all representative of Dean\'s true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\'s  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean\'s mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it \t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the sins of other individuals. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\'s sins. That I made public announcements of the sins of others --sins, BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saints, thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints,  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.',3

1272,'       Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can  engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order  harmonics of the Earth\'s gravitational field can pump energy into a  satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of  months to years.        My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT  satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In  particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in  altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude  of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18  March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the  limitations of NORAD\'s software -- but that\'s another story.)       This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71  degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is  unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But  it\'s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the  situation.       (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

888,' I hope I didn\'t award custody, Rich.  I purposely used handle in order to  avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are aberrations like scientific creationism).  I used best in part to indicate  that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written how and when.  Nobody seems to argue over what.   Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\'m not trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works. On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I  think the masses can\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are  incapable; they just don\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to  be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore  it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for  dispensing answers to who and why.  I suggest that this holds regardless of  the truth in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.   In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as real as scientific facts and  explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).     No.  In fact, I don\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals.  Isn\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was  created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might  presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued  that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\'t have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\'s a tough one for people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not  explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words,  I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific  as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but  I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will  be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty  convoluted here; I hope I\'ve made sense.     I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how,  when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment,  reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when,  and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the  naturalists\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely  leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.    Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\'t it?  Well, I am sure there are plenty of scientific creationist rebuttals out there  somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.

893,'Archive-name: space/new_probes Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $  UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES      Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below     would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s     satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn\'s rings.  \t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory) \t ------------------------------------------------------------- \t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch \t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist \t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist \t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist \t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist \t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival \t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release \t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry \t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission \t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)       GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

Anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong (and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn\'t do it is PROOF positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  Cannibalism is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one alive.  Many other cultures (including many American Indian cultures) eat/ate the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of the departed.  Hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.

916,'LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics                 Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists            CLAIM to be looking for a Unified Field Theory in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the Reciprocal System, is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.                      (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL            DATUM).                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson\'s Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal RECIPROCITY.                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\'s lack of a fancy PH.D. degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a unified field theory that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that epicycles, crystal spheres,            geocentricity, flat earth theory, etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\'s Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson\'s organization, THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE, and Editor of            their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY.  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   Super Collider BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super            Collider, in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific            value.                      Most physicists don\'t realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (mesons, hyperons, ALLEGED quarks, etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the Supercollider?!                                 Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum.                       In Larson\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove Einstein\'s General Theory of Relativity.                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than General Relativity can, by            INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity.  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of Special            Relativity, including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing            about this.]                            In regard to mass increases, it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\'s Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called Big Bang (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION, by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the 3-degree background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\'s success:            In his first book in 1959, THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE, Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the Cosmic Sector.  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by fusion.  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter, neutron            stars, black holes, etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode\'s Law.                         Black Hole FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black            holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole, and            concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original black holes.                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black            holes, etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, it is            clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser.  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\'s            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER, by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\'s book NOTHING BUT            MOTION] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.                            Note that in Larson\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the unit frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the unit rate).             (Unit velocity is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson\'s Theory.)  [I might have the above and            below labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\'s Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the unit frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            science (or physics, or astronomy, etc.), as well as            the scientific literature and the education systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

1174,' Wrong about what?   I think they are correct in thinking that a  well-placed bomb or six would get headlines, but I think they are  wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a  Buddhist.  Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans  are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like the Chinese occupiers.   Every action is its own reward.   On the other hand, people who are aware of the occupation are mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up with it.   And what does it cost us to admire them?   Zip.   Yes they are, and whether this serves them well or not depends on  whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence. And without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious traditions?   The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists, just as the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements as terrorists.   Better off in what way?   As proponents of pacifism or as  proponents of political autonomy?  And better off in what time-scale?   The Soviet Empire practised cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities, some of which resisted violently, and some of which did not, but in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least some of the minorities survived.  Now some of the minorities are fighting one another.    Is that because they have to, or because violent resistance to an oppressive Empire legitimized violence?',3

It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth\'s gravity field and ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag. ',2

The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.  \tThe degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the  level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the  consequences of the proposition are.    \tIf the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain  why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between  two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their  distance apart.   \tRemember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the  consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of  affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law,  they are irrelevent when theorizing about the Truth of the law.  \tGiven that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including  the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of  affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find The Truth?    \tBy the way, what is Truth?

An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder\'s USGS publication Map Projections--A Working Manual, USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It\'s a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one\'s $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     An Album of Map Projections, USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:     Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS.

They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn\'t blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.  If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon. ',2

They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting.

966,'Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this Banner reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the Environmental Billboard.  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Environmental Billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s delicate protective ozone layer, according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s atmosphere. According to IMI, as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer. The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply.    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brian\'s questions:        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon someone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding for this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.

967,'   Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given   it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is   the blood that makes atonement for the soul.  The Old Testament was very big on the eye for an eye business.  It makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to repay moral wrongdoing.  I know about sanctification.  I\'ve been taught all about it in Sunday school, catechism class, and theology classes.  But even after all that, I still can\'t accept it.  Maybe I\'m still not understanding it, or maybe I\'m just understanding it all too well.  From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent man is wrong.  I\'ve tried repeatedly over the course of several years to accept it, but I just can\'t.  If this means that I can\'t accept the premise that a god who would allow this is \'perfectly good\', then so be it.   If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing, then I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me. Be warned, however, that I\'ve heard all the most common arguments before, and they just don\'t convince me. ',3

969,'  I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.  The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC\'s history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry average, and that, in my opinion, SGI\'s history is better than DEC\'s.  (And what is DEC doing with it\'s MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to abandon it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R4400\'s and TFP\'s and R5\'s?)',1
970,' If Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I\'m sure it will be added to the list of targets.

971,'Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.   The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven\'t had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.  Dani Eder ',2

973,'This kind of argument cries for a comment...     : >>...God did not create : >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns. : >  : >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is : >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn\'t we?  Perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this.  Try Watson\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn\'t mean it\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we\'ve thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually, neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I\'d replace created with formed, since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I\'m sorry I can\'t give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration?   I can understand Scott\'s reaction:  : > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!   :  : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you don\'t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one\'s own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more complex, tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\'t make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven\'t seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\'s fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing evil is god\'s fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\'t know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don\'t think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are meant (presumably by God) to be : punished by getting diseases.  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it\'s not perfect (yet).  But I\'m working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\'t explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a why behind? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I\'m sure I\'d find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I\'m sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

You may be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had whites who supported their \'cause\' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\'s great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being nigger-lovers and such.  I guess I\'ve decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\'t know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\'t get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God\'s will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\'t change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a conditional love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\'ll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditional love, one that calls people just as they are.  Sure there are things that will \'naturally\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people\'s expectations. In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like \'sexuality\' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It\'s funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\'s pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who\'s posters are appearing all over Colorado called S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T. (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is Working for a fag-free America with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don\'t \'measure up\', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to include people.  I have several of Dr. Martin\'s books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning \'cults.\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don\'t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?  Whatever',3

Also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must, : by your arguement, die.  By your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context means. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species, the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> But it gets worse.

Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental.

Here\'s pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you\'ve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it\'s a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value, and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard. :  : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual life-style.

Common law rights are vague and situational; that\'s why the people insisted on a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government.

992,'Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.

1000,'I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature. This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:  \tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25 \t Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in .25.  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:  \tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25 \t This results in all the coordinates ending in either 0.25 or 0.75  whichever is closer.

1002,'    The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke\'s text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what\'s that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted.

Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn\'t say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what\'s better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid of your emotions.

You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It\'s wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is the world an undesireable place a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn\'t.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn\'t.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn\'t.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don\'t follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to priests,  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do not follow Catholicism or any ism.  I follow Christ.   Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and that\'s it.  Don\'t contradict yourself.  You have no reason to live a good life.  It doesn\'t do you any good in the end.  Your life doesn\'t do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail.  Jesus\'s death was like a seed.  He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did you miss the entire John passage as well?      Forget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget that I know how to put a sentence together.

1015,'    As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we\'d need    to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization    on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isn\'t all that much, is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it\'s only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You\'d be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you\'d be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob\'s your uncle.  I\'ll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.  Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors? Who else might be interested?  Would they buy it, given that it\'s a _lot_ more expensive, and not much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your key growth market). I\'ll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of identity).',2

Vest, recently named by Vice President Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives from government and industry and academic experts from across the country to participate in an independent review of the redesign options being developed by NASA.  I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. America\'s future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care, said Vest. We have assembled a diverse panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical task.  The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA\'s redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space station international partners also are being asked to  participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory committee will submit its recommendations in June.

You refer to # differing interpretations of create, and say that many Christians may # not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is # truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.  It may be irrelevant to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say bias?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You\'re right, the bottom line IS truth, independant from you or anyone else.  Since you proclaim truths as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what authority you do this?  Because it says so in the Bible?  --Does the Bible say so, or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval?  Excuse moi, but your line of truths haven\'t moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the preachers of truth on this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever. BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees: ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips, but your hearts are far removed from me...  # Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent, you say granted the Mormon # belief... You can\'t grant your conclusion and then expect the point to # have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address # and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the # conclusion that you grant.  Sophistry.  Look who\'s talking: jumping to conclusions?  You wouldn\'t do that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever.  # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS # belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.  A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you. Jesus and lucifer are not the same, silly, and you know it.  (...)  # The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is # nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible # says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:  Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not children (=followers/redeemed) of God, but it doesn\'t mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; #        (Matthew 13:38)  kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring.

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of official doctrine is obviously very important.  McConkie\'s views have been controversial (e.g. The Seven Deadly Heresies has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation).  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to as McConkie\'s Bible in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\'s books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

1026,' True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn\'t have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\'s like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was nice and clean (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here militarily justified.  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified. I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I\'ve always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\'ve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\'s ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.   I don\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn\'t intervene.  Not that we don\'t care, but we can\'t be the world\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\'t have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\'s oil  interests, caused us to take action.   [...]  I\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.  Well, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable, but that\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we\'re not the saviors of the world.  We can\'t police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I\'ll support it.  I, for one, do not agree with the present US policy of sucking up to them as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I\'m not an expert on California law, or even US law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system, but let\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans, perhaps.  Peers doesn\'t mean those who do the same thing, like having murderers judge murderers.  It means having people from the same station in life, presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent\'s motivation(s).   OK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW, I never used the word conspiracy.  I don\'t accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn\'t say that it\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\'t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\'t say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\'t mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\'t see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don\'t!  I just don\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don\'t believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  so deplorable.  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died,  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to  the Allied bombing.  Regards,',0
1027,' I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works very well.  That\'s not my point.  I\'m >philosophically< opposed to it because of its complexity.  This complexity has led to some programs\' poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files, other programs\' inability to load TIFF images (though they\'ll save them, of course), and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.  As the saying goes, It\'s not me I\'m worried about- it\'s all the abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and unnecessary) complexity of the format.  In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized emphasis mine):  The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB), and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many image-generating applications out there now.

1034,'930418  Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.] The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]   Does one man\'s words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior  of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss\' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order  for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   Kellner\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss\'s Masonic publication, \'Oriflamme\'.  On Kellner\'s death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \'Jubilee\' edition of the \'Oriflamme\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.   Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\'s request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by    Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,     Caliph of the United States of America,       Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the \'Law of Thelema\' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?   Will I?   I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has \'gone soft\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.   Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments  I followed my intuition, and I\'ve found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\'m happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.    This doesn\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.  I am I!',3

When was the last time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don\'t actually know; these aren\'t rhetorical questions.)  How \'bout some Supreme court justices?    One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news program on a local station...The promo said something like Who are these cults, and why do they prey on the young?  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF BAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn\'t preying on the young, I don\'t know what is...  I used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly thereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom, who really insisted that I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up as a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I\'ve heard in my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn\'t believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me.

1042,'  : There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread : that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.  This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However, I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations.   It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual, for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science. However, science has one advantage theology doesn\'t: it is self- correcting, with nature as its judge.   It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self- consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer a bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to psychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe from its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.   There is no need : for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by : physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is : determnined.  Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question, and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have any meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent free will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their perspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not?   : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence, it\'s just a happy accident.  Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of  numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same principle - only the systems that can start replicating will survive, those which don\'t don\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)  : For an atheist, no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- : an event can have value.   From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from my perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have a perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective perspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if I think about what it would it be like in their position, I will eventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution. Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity, too.   Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.) for starters.  : How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It : seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what : in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to : establish your values.  C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is severely flawed.  Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some others, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools, they also became better at killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\'s own people.  The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people together, under one god. Their god did not care much about people of other nations.   At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along with it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)  : Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what : difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or : otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only : way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\'t like it : - that\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any absolute sense.  It looks like you haven\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there is an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may  value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result of some physical event), and other\'s happiness, too, if the observer comes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is, without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their meaning.   It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_  personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths do not exist.   The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others\' existence.  Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and many other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed.   : That you don\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or God\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your : objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\'ve been : conditioned; there is no truth content. The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.  The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism is still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.  You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective point of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view, _which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being, has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not cease to be subjective.   From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither does pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are  inherently subjective.   Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if we don\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god gave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my fault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\'s own and then to get mad at this.   God must be schizophrenic.  : All of this being so, you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, : etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever.  Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.  Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being, _including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his own point of view, and his morals are his own.   Petri ',0

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur\'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn\'t swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  \'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn\'t reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man\'s history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

When did you look into my heart and see if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart.  I can\'t say that I love homosexuals as I should- I can\'t say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don\'t know very many homosexuals as it is.    But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to  homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to  stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous  thing.   That is slander.

But there is also the problem of what has been called unsanctified mercy. Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in  this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in  the flesh.  This is truely sad.

Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus. But we shouldn\'t water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn\'t go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told another not to say good bye to His family.

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. #The point is that theism is *a* factor.  That\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)  #>Gullibility, #>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more #>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of #>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators #>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing. #  #That\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the #field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.  If you believe that, you\'re incredibly naive.  #>Now, *some* #>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism, #>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned #>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction #>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm? #> #That\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to #repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to #fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, #there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.  No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\'t implied by what you say before, because you\'re trying to sneak in innate features of [all] theism.  The word you\'re groping for is some.  #Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.  No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism, since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed to the case you are trying to make?  #And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw #men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.  I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\'s because it\'s an irrational and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us  split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls.  #>|>(2)  Define irrational belief.  e.g., is it rational to believe that #>|>     reason is always useful? #>|> #>| #>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason.

It\'s still begging the question, however.  And though that certainly is allowed, it\'s not rational.  And you claiming to be rational and all.  At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing we had that before [we didn\'t hear a _refutation_ before, so we\'re back.   Deal with it] : you can\'t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone who thinks reason is crap won\'t buy it, you see.  #Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics #and mathematics are therfore circular.

Depending on the further #contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can #have interesting effects.  Peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\'t my  catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they  don\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\'s the conjunction of B asserts B and jail/kill dissenters that is important, and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no axe to grind here.  ',0

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  Galactic Pot-Healer A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  A Maze of Death Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  VALIS The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  The Divine Invasion God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  The Handmaid\'s Tale A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it right again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  The Bible This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you\'ll know what all the fuss is about.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  The Existence of God (Revised Edition), Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism (1977) and was concluded with Faith and Reason (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie\'s The Miracle of Theism.  In the revised edition of The Existence of God, Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  The Miracle of Theism, Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as replacements for God such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

1082,' OK, here\'s at least one Christian\'s answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God\'s purposes.  Verse 18 says For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, accomplished what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about doing away with the Law.  That was not  Jesus\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be doing  away with the Law because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God\'s Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it\'s purpose, i.e. our tutor to lead us to Christ, and now, we are no longer under a tutor.  The law has been fulfilled  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the last will and testament of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\'s purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the mysteries of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That\'s one Christian\'s explanation.  I don\'t claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read  this far...',3

1161,'  Diplomatic :-)  I realize I\'m fighting Occam\'s razor in this argument, so I\'ll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly, I\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\'re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program them into the computer. You can, of course, \'obfuscate\' the trick, and write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see, the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material, much of which isn\'t used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but (again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \'if you see object X, then perform action Y,\' and we don\'t seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what conclusions to draw from it\'s experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also, neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\'s code?  The next problem is the sticky question of What is colour? (replace \'colour\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the materialist viewpoint is that it\'s the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a computer won\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn\'t? It shouldn\'t, because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?    A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction, with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called \'Unitary Evolution\' (or \'U\'), is governed by Schroedinger\'s equation and is well known. The second process, called various things such as \'collapse of the wavefunction\' or \'state vector reduction\' (or \'R\'), and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a \'measurement\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \'something else,\' which I shall imaginitively call \'part X.\' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the wavefunction. Note, though, that we\'d need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway, I\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear superpositions of anything, although there are alternative explainations for this. I\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X, but since this is only speculation, that won\'t matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.  I\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\'s OK with you :-)   --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Kevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk             Don\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.',0
1085,'Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a safe mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments turned off rather than just safed.  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....    I\'ve heard the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft causes radio noise.  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed safe mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a pause mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission drift phase.  So any holes in all this? ',2
1086,' The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir), as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit under the shroud.

1091,'Hi Steve,  As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this software - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix\'s are the same, you know! As far as many bugs go, it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)  Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible.  The main problem is that I don\'t have access to other platforms than the RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it.  As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn\'t read the few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients only, so if you\'re in there on your own, then you\'re not going to see anything!

Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don\'t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\'t that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  ->\tNiether was he a lunatic.

There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\'t one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  ->\tSome other things to note.

The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I\'m sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don\'t understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn\'t a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn\'t overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn\'t overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn\'t address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn\'t include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget.

1139,'  The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image processing software that much faster. When they use the _same_ deconvolution  software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some  incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will  _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.    Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works  realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.

So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.  If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.     Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are subtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.',2
1126,' Yeah, and it\'s also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don\'t argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so great, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t, I\'ll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I don\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a real product.

1130,'  Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.  If you\'re considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:  For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net.  We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.  The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been unable to deliver.  Our system produces near VHS quality at 30 fields per second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting.  If you can get past this problem, you\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.  Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\'ve ever used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\'ll recognize the methodology and the user interface.  The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21 Apple mon- itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc), Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.  For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality that will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more effects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system will look better.  We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

1132,'     Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book Brainsex by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book Brainsex.  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading Islam and Women -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that other religions are no different is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader.   The Prophet\'s first wife, who died just before the Hijra (the Prophet\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.',0

I did not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an answer.  Thus far, I have not received an answer.

1154,'  Isn\'t that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors, specifically the Patriarch Abraham (zl).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave gifts (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.  So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture, your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn\'t stop us from respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.

1157,'       TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the  Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

1161,'There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among Southern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and I suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.   *  For a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity. (Mr Holly\'s father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the Masons.)  The SBC\'s Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department, which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality. However, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the feeling that they were saying You got the wrong answer last time, try to do better and get the answer we want.)  Anyway, there\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but the dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it, but everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things such as: This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.  The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well- known Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings of Masonry are supportive of Christian faith and practice.  Examples of the latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.  On the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible with Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they are not meant seriously), the undeniably pagan and/or occultic writings of some Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many Masonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole aren\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)   The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals. This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges, and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may not.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably influenced how the report came out.   *  The information above was gleaned from The Religious Herald, a publication of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and Baptists Today, which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a big issue among some Baptists.  8-)  Because I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are relevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.

1162,' [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to \'or\' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print. Who\'d have guessed?',1

Please do not stoop to the level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud, insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.  The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it?  Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable,  on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with Catholic doctrine.  Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic enough to have a place on a.s.s.  I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.

1180,'  This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.   The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran\'s version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, (forty days and forty nights, pair of every animal, etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran\'s description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage.  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.  The above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.    -- ',0

These *facts* exist with or without a theory.  The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.  The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation, relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact... or even why.  A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation,  a model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.  In science a theory is something that is supported by the  evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis  is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don\'t have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.    I asked Jim the following:  Jim replied by saying   But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject Silence is concurrence:     Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn\'t a crime.  I don\'t have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I\'m certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.  Does silence is concurrence imply that Jim thinks that because I didn\'t respond to Weiss\' articles I must condone Weiss\' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn\'t want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.   But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim\'s next  gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn\'t help make it more clear, Jim), titled Inductive Logic:   More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I axed his articles, but not Weiss\' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can\'t see where he is going with this.  But I can help him with his induction.  I\'ve written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

1020,'I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that will do compositing of a series of pictures?  What I mean by compositing is, say I have a live video clip (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do manual compositing also.

1234,'prb@access.digex.com (Pat) Pontificated:  What I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.    I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in that essentially says If you never hear from Earth again, here\'s what to do.  This was a back up in the event a receiver burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but still some data).    Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for startup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might not be such a big loss.  Obviously you can\'t plan for everything, but the most obvious things can be considered. ',2

1294,' If you\'re doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.   You\'d almost certainly use air.  Given that you have to pressurize with *something*, safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable (even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing, to avoid needing a ventilation system, it\'s nice if the hangar atmosphere is breathable in a pinch -- it makes mask functioning much less critical).',2
1241,'      I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur\'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur\'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur\'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur\'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   ',0

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: What does it all mean?      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual, ASC G&C 2102,  \tDuring the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is \tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower \tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) \torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a \tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other \tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort \tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of \tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining \tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target \tin second stage.      This really is a good answer, but it\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\'ll try     to interpret.      1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack \tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the \trelative wind) and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line \tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly \tnegative angle (a negative q-alpha).\tThis causes a little bit of \tdownward force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z \tdirection) and this force alleviates structural loading. \tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\'re about the \tmost delicate part of the vehicle.      3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more \tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or \tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be \tthe case if we didn\'t roll (performance gain).      4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated \tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort \tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (decreased abort maneuver \tcomplexity).      5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio \tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio \tantennae on the Orbiter (improved S-band look angles).      6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a \thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is \tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east \t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity \tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: \tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. \tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its \tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, Why isn\'t the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the top     [Orbiter side] and the bottom [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\'s.  (A side note: the     Saturn V\'s also had a roll program.  Don\'t ask me why -- I\'m a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the roll     maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion, a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It\'s worth asking if yours doesn\'t.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A D engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An F engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size O are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines.

1315,'  This posting is totally uncalled for in rec.scouting.  The point has been raised and has been answered.  Roger and I have clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue; specifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of the Scout Oath (specifically, the promise to live morally straight).  There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because it\'s like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can\'t control their race but they can control their behavior).  What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue? Nobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or worship as they please or don\'t please,  but it doesn\'t mean that BSA is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious and moral standards on which our society has been established and on which it should continue to be based.',0
1316,'  I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.  Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don\'t like it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a floating billboard out there, you can\'t turn it off.  It\'s the same  reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.  George.  \tIt\'s called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry. If ytou don\'t like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental civil rights.  I say:  \tAny reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show \tyou that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice, \tdiscrimination, and violence against others of different \traces, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.  If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia, they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums. In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.  I say: What I\'m objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably, would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and aesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild and unspoiled things, including the night sky.  George',2

1318,'  : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I\'ve been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though 90 \% of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland, religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god just in case? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal\'s Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn\'t care - it believes, but doesn\'t know what or how.   People don\'t usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle, they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not born in the Spirit, but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I\'m afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn\'t notice ;-) )  : Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the : other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I\'ve yet to see good reasons to believe in gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics.   Is usefulness any criterion?  Petri ',0

1320,'  If you\'re talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation, well, it\'s obviously a risk one takes.   I\'m not an objectivist, so I\'m not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization.  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the perspective of what\'s being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).  An analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is that the better descriptive language is not available.

1323,'  The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit \'fuzzy regions\'.  These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that \'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, we\'ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\'s a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is we are.  But if society is those who make the rules, that\'s a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that\'s yet another.  I don\'t claim to have the answers, either, but I don\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things about the US system, at least in principle.  # #>#2)How do they define what is acceptable? # #>Depends. #On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).  Well, ideally they don\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO. # #>#3)How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position? # #>By adopting a default position that people\'s moral decisions #>are none of society\'s business, # #So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?  Because sometimes that\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when it is, and equally importantly, when it isn\'t.  # and only interfering when it\'s truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it\'s a sort of liar\'s paradox: force is necessary for freedom.   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\'t object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\'t arise if we don\'t actively wish to take way anyone\'s freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a justice system.  How can we even define that term?  Only by consensus, I guess.  #  Thus you #>get a situation where The law often allows what honour forbids, which I\'ve #>come to believe is as it should be.   # #I admit I don\'t understand that statement.

1111,'Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more bare-bones.  In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn\'t get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it in.  After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.  So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference.  So, on to the substance. The question was   Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass?  Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first.  This is to the best of my recollection what he said.  As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers  about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point.  So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that  they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own.  Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts.  He won\'t tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it.    Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?',2

1344,'Is it just me, or has this part gotten beyond useful?  Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie\'s life.  If that\'s correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don\'t accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I\'m picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn\'t say in agreement) with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (legally as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards,  Dew',0

THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to            most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                            This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged            edition of THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, 1959.             Volume I is NOTHING BUT MOTION (1979), and Volume II is            THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER (1988).                            Most books and journal articles on the subject of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial            differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by            contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.             Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual            validity.                            Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor            of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State            University.  He developed the Theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the            properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements            they contain.                            THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION describes the astrophysical            portions of Larson\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of            grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and            astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time:                            (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                            (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                            From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a            COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the            concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with            translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-           vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including            EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959            book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,            several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They            are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And            when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation            ready for those also.                            As a result of his theory, which he called THE            RECIPROCAL SYSTEM, Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,            including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,            quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),            nuclear physics, general relativity, relativistic mass            increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in            stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be            nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very            critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,            solutions in principle, no other way declarations, etc.,            used to maintain them.                            THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION is divided into 31 chapters.             It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy            formation from the MYTHICAL big bang is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of            SINGLE stars.                            Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according            to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                            Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            Larson\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an            OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY            BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any            visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional            coincidence).  Larson\'s explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER            HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the cosmic            sector.  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a            RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed            of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE            dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the            bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly            at random.                            Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books, journal articles, and leading physicists and            astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book            Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey, by William K. Hartmann,            says, Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form.... Unfortunately we cannot.  Larson\'s book contains            LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are            WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,            astronomers, and astrophysicists.

So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation), could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays  being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.

1356,': I will clarify my earlier quote.  God\'s laws were originally written for  : the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here\'s the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God\'s chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God\'s existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God\'s chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don\'t mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn\'t address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today\'s world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I\'ll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don\'t believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don\'t know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don\'t know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I\'ve seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don\'t know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it\'s a lifestyle that changes one\'s : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God\'s will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God\'s will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I\'m doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:',3
1357,'    It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille\'s translations (in his book, The Bible, the Qur\'an and Science) for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   ...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.  (Also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator\'s interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You\'re right, what the verses _do_ contain isn\'t all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that\'s how he\'s a Dr.) thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur\'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)',0
1358,'        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no notes so I\'ll try to wing it...           Here\'s how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\'s) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\'s an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\'t work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  ',2

1368,'   It\'s not a bad question: I don\'t have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn\'t be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere\'s origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it\'s just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I\'ll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.',1

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2  This equation can be rewritten into the following form:       2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2  Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1  For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.  In \'Numerical Recipes in C\' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.  The best fitting sphere will have  - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2) - radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).

1379,'    I\'m sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word create is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.     I should have said given the Mormon belief.  If you disagree with the Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important point.     Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by such terms.     It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being offspring of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually born again of Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is how language works, Robert, and it\'s why making someone an offender for a word is dangerous.   <...>     On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say that one must simply look at the Bible to see what it teaches, but centuries of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says. Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the scriptures?     Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie\'s belief in same.  We keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)     On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie\'s words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large number of Mormons.',3

1386,' John 12:24-26: Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.   He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn\'t automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn\'t the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That\'s precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You\'ve got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it\'s not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here\'s the problem with that: substitute Moslem or Buddhist or Satanist instead of Christian, and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you\'ve got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you\'re bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren\'t any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I\'ll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.',3

If nothing else, a working SSTO is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G range.   True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I don\'t think it would be enough to attract the investors given the risks involved.

1401,'What an exciting thread (finally!)  Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu  mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence  worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is  the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by  soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-  antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and  grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.  Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.  Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman  Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of  Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship  was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership  in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in  ancient times is fascinating!  Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.  I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the  Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels  of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns  in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I\'m not sure  that they had Mithraic significance or not.  I don\'t know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the  Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.  Someone mentioned bullfighting.

1403,'                  God being unknowable, I can\'t comment on His motives, but it would be distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of  our own.  For sanity\'s sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes  through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex  canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another,  or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God\'s message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility  for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that  God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source  for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.        Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness.  You might have said burp, for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about taking the Lord\'s  name in vain as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of  hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.   If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for example, God\'s code could include, Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on, but this law would be inapplicable to us. Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God.   But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God\'s moral code, you have a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category morality can be sensibly applied.',3

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:  \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Louw and Nida \tRobinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Grimm \tWord study Concordance, Tynsdale \tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  \t early Christian Writings, Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon, Perschbacher  A couple simply stated hanged oneself, and a couple were more explicit  and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging. A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is strangle, throttle or choke (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, Robinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament, not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word apagchw has two root words: gchw is the to strangle root, and the root word apo means literally away. This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word apagello means to send a message).  Apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo, which means to kill. In literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle, strangle to put out of the way, and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word apacgw does mean to hang, it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means to hang oneself, to end one\'s life by hanging. He then notes the the use of apacgw in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by hanging. Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of death, and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of apacgw (ie: Since the word apacgw was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of apacgw:   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie the the Hebrew say and died), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added and died, the correct translation would still be apacgw, as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing apacgw and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose\'s statement about trees around the Potter\'s Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\' betrayal an iniquity, but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\' actions an iniquity either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him Buy what we need for the feast; or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that apacgw means suicide.  You see, since Judas\' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the Field of Blood would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\'s field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\'s all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.   \t\t\t\tLater,  \t\t\t\tDave Butler  \tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence. \t\t\t\tDavid Hume, Philosopher \t\t\t\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding',3

1429,'  Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to fixing/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn\'t happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.',0

The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\'s main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin, of course, at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  [Mary] will bear a son, and you,        Joseph, will name him \'Jesus\' (which means G\'d is        salvation), for he will save his people from their        sins.  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),        king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the        lord G\'d said to Isaiah, go to meet with Ahaz...         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,        naturally) saying, Ask a sign of G\'d your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.  But,        Ahaz said, I won\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.  Then (Isaiah) said, Hear then, O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman        is with child and will bear a son, and name him        Immanuel, which means, G\'d is with us.   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further, he the Hebrew word almah, (young woman), as specifically, virgin.  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G\'d walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.         And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people), the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba\'als, and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\'s oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G\'d.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled, because they were        no more.     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are no more.  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her children, it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).        As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus\'s life to enhance the message of the church\'s gospel.        Because of the whole story\'s similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The children the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\'d comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the prophecy Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who He is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\'s mother that she will,         [Judges 13.5]  ...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\'d.  But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah, He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,         [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has        borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations\' salvation by G\'d.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a servant going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\'s parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\'t arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his        name.  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my        chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the light of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic ...the coastlands await his law. to the Christologic, the Gentiles will hope in his name.   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name.  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, a people robbed and plundered...   So, we see that when Matthew\'s attempt at prophecy is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a day was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\'t forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ninth hour, which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, rose, before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew\'s little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the plain message any better.  Matthew says,         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,          You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this        people\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of        hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and        understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal        them.  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\'d, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G\'d said, Go, and say to this        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and        see, but do not perceive.\'   Make the heart of this        people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their        eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and        turn and be healed.  Then Isaiah said, How long,        lord?  And he said, Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the        land is utterly desolate, and the G\'ds take men far        away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled. The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G\'d who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet\'s warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon\'s (and David\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\'t understand Jesus\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\'s verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G\'d to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew\'s prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus\'s parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet, I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have        heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children, but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\'s name as this prophet.  Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further, they speak of things known, that our fathers have told us.  Jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world.  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew\'s prophecies aren\'t the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.         Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don\'t get to see God anymore.         We\'re too lazy; we\'re not zealous enough; we\'re        sinful; it\'s just his plan; we put too many of our        own demands on G\'d\'s appearance; if we had the right        faith, if we  were willing to meet G\'d on his terms...       Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\'d.  You, dear reader, have not seen G\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\'ve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G\'d.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G\'d.  Sometimes, they say, See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G\'d.   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\'d into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G\'d as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G\'d the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.  Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet, saying,         Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your king is        coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a        ass-colt.  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\'s version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,         [Mt 21.16]  Haven\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, Haven\'t you read? for the source reads,         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\'d, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew\'s pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,         The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until        I put your enemies under your feet.  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It\'s tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But, there are problems.        In Jesus\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\'s rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\'s time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah\'s advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,         YHVH\'s utterance to my lord: \tSit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your        footstool.         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.  The word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is adoni, and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means lord, a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G\'d.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of David, or a psalm about David.  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David\'s covenant and endorsement from G\'d.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David\'s age.  We have extensive tales of David\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G\'d had put his show of favour for David\'s kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\'s question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus\'s career as told by even Matthew.  But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian.  I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter\'s Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief        priests, taking the silver, said, It isn\'t lawful for        us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood        money.  So they... bought a potter\'s field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,         And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\'s        field, as the lord directed me.  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, Cast        them to the treasury, --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, treasury, had been replaced by the King James Scholars with to the potter, precisely because this made Matthew\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed treasury, which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah\'s context, whereas potter\'s field is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\'s situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the prophecy as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew\'s work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:        Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not        drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,         They parted my garments among them, and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, I thirst.  A bowl of        vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished;  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;        and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and        for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in the psalm asks G\'d for the damnation of the crucifiers, whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, Father, forgive them, the        don\'t know what they do!  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\'s drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.         With the prophecy of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, What of the casting of lots?  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus\'s clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you        don\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers.  Indeed, Jesus doesn\'t do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.  This seems to fit Jesus\'s execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword, my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I\'m sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,         16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of        evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, like the lion (ka\'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to ka\'aru.   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the prophecy this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn\'t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren\'t bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus\'s life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\'s crucifixion.  John\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus\'s execution,         [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        The will look on him whom they\'ve pierced.  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John\'s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.   Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,        one on his right, one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says,         He was reckoned with the transgressors.  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him. [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed, Aren\'t you the messiah?! Save        yourself, and us!  This certainly fits with Mark\'s recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, Save yourself! and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,        Don\'t you fear G\'d, since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,        Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.         And Jesus answered, Verily I say to you, today you        will be with me in paradise.  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn\'t seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\'s.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\'s        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your        coming, and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for        many will come in my name, saying, I am the christ.          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death,        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a        testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.              So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days,        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know        that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these        things, you will know that He is near, at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the        angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,        you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn\'t know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, this generation shall not pass away... really means this race of people will not pass away...  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\'t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway.  As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.',0

In turn my father has helped with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay  and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more fortunate in the community.

1442,'  Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic cult (although not the only one.)

1444,' Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a small fishing village by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had opulent and flourishing bazaars and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware. During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel\'s withdrawel in 1984, Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a major city)?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.   A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don\'t doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don\'t most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don\'t seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven\'t seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn\'t listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it?

We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - you\'ve lost it!  The me generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle - to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened to your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more before putting the first rubber on the road.  Max Hunter - you didn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn V\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!',2

This alt.taoism could also be a refuge  for debates about what Taoism *REALLY* means or speculations on sexual alchemy, etc..  e.g. (from Thyagi again):  Kent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi\'s article):   I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of place. What\'s happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic, Alchemy,  Zen, etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they  want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The Tao of this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions like the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)  Any other comments/ideas?

1481,'Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible. O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research is a real question for me. O\'Connor said everything is fair game, including dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.  O\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O\'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [wingless Orbiter] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a moderate cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the high cost option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.',2

However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical.

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS  \tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.  \tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.  \tBasically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks, Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.  \tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.  \tWhen we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate, said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.  \tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.  \tWe have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs, Heflin said.  In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.  \tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training runs will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.  \tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.  \tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.  \tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.  \tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.  \tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.',2

1488,'Let\'s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon\'s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so global adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 3d surface, solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?  Thanks,',1

1496,'This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1 ping-pong game, and I don\'t have any strong disagreement, so I\'ll try to stick to the one thing I don\'t quite follow about the argument:  It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Bible was enlightened for its times (i.e. closer to what we would consider morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one hand [I hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on the other hand:   }|> }Disclaimer:  I\'m speaking from the Jewish perspective, }|> }where the Bible means what many call the Old Testament, }|> }and where the interpretation is not necessarily the }|> }raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries }|> }and traditions passed down through Jewish communities. }|>  }|> This seems the crux to me: if you judge the Bible according to a long }|> line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day, }|> rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course }|> it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values. } }But if that\'s how the Bible is actually being used today, }shouldn\'t that be how we should judge it?  If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn\'t Consumer\'s Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That\'s possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was enlightened for its times. To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I\'m not arguing that the Bible is disgusting, though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don\'t think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don\'t know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don\'t think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.',0

1060,' God never changes.  He still loves us.  Sending Jesus was one of His attempts to reconcile with mankind.  The nature of God has not changed.   Sinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death.  There are several OT passages to back this up.  God is God.  He cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in His midst.  And the Israelites knew this!  And still, some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed.  Were these people KIND and LOVing themselves?  God gave them every break He could but in the end, He really had no choice in the matter.  Seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own, He sent His Son to die for us - to be the ultimate sin offering.  Now we live in the age of grace.    He sent His Son as a consolation to us, out of love.    Hey, let\'s be fair for a moment here.  KIND and LOVING does not mean a free ride.  There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship. Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that  children can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means administering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a  parent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of life such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and  what is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us, be it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what He has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.  In parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through with it, the children will not take that parent\'s words very seriously. God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and what not to do.  By life\'s trials, we see the folly of doing our own will rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting Him when it comes time for Judgement.  Do we follow Him?  I will.  Peace be with you,  Malcolm Lee  :) ',3

Because his messengership is universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that relate to almost all species of creation.     Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe, each species of creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and each bearing one of his miracles.     Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood, here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports.     The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) fall into two main categories:        The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal  events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his  declaration of prophethood.        The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences  of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions:       1) Those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood, and  \t2) Those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:   \t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral conduct and perfection, and      2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.   The last part again has two branches:   \t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur\'an and spirituality, and  \t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last  branch is again divided into two categories:   \t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings  that occured during his mission either to break the  stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by consensus.   \t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon Allah (SWT)\'s instructions.  Now starting from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)  (1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could not completely conform to the order of this classification.

1519,'  Thanks for the information!  I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter\'s -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter\'s influence.

The idea was that you\'d detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a pusher plate attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can\'t see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you\'re going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they\'re there.

Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   program with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects\' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

TCL-Image:   Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and   analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,   and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.   TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm   development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily   extensible through script (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You\'ll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn\'t   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100\%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don\'t know...    Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100  Dapple Systems --------------   High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to   work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of   global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.    Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by painting it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator paint with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose.    Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn\'t have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing programs for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software.    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: Laplacian, medium noise filter, etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can\'t be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.    Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900  IPLab -----   Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277   FAX 703-281-2509    Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or   pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.

ERDAS -----   ERDAS will do all of the things you want:  rectification,   classification, transformations (canned & user-defined), overlays,   filters, contrast enhancement, etc. ... I was using it on my thesis &   then changed the topic a bit & that work became secondary.    ERDAS, Inc. 2801 Buford Highway Suite 300 Atlanta, GA 30329 404-248-9000   FAX   404-248-9400  RSVGA -----   I have been getting up to speed on a program called RSVGA available from   Eidetic Digital Image Ltd. in British Columbia.  Its for IBM PC\'s or   clones, cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not   as fast or as powerful, though I have had only limited experience with   Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good   starter program except for the obtuse manual  IMAGINE-32 ----------   It\'s a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called Imagine32   or Image32 The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,   subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.   It can also display a number of images simultaneously.   The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA.   PC Vista --------   It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to   be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been  \trichmond@bllac.berkeley.edu \trichmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu    and his s-mail address is:    Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720    The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source   code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and   a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code,   you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work,   but will require substantial modifications.    To receive the documentation and nine double-density (360K) floppies   (or three quad-density 3-1/2 inch floppies (1.44M) with everything on them,   just send a request for PC-Vista, together with your name and a US-Mail   address, to   \tOffice of Technology Licensing \t2150 Shattuck Ave., Suite 510 \tBerkeley, Ca. 94704    Include a check (Traveller\'s Checks are fine) or purchase order for $150.00   in U.S. dollars, if your address is inside the continental U.S., or $165.00   otherwise, made out to Regents of the University of California   to cover duplication and mailing costs.

It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It\'s image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD\'s vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.   Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - AIPS++ - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) It\'s written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\'s environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn\'t that   difficult to write your own with their programmer\'s module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\'s Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters\'\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98\% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system. o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to    HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

1529,'One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that without bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup. It almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart. Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted write about.        How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If you want to be religious aren\'t there more plausable books out there? Seriously, the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they invented.        For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn\'t god say not to EVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn\'t god say not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don\'t you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?  Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn\'t he write anything? Anyone know?        I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot. The only reason xtianity escaped the middle east is because a certain roman who\'s wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome xtian after a bad dream.

Allow me one last inter- jection then please:  Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you\'ve excepted the Messianic for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it\'s these religious  Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy,  rather than by faith, who won\'t agree?  Orthodox Jews?    As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains  unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often  look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree. For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I\'m not so  sure the atheists can be counted out.   For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham, or David in accepting God\'s Word? Is the particular covenant to which one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might  understand why I think it\'s premature to assert who will and won\'t agree.',3

1538,'I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted. I\'ve been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar\'s article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed, with the disclaimer (fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and false statements]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the ISLAM: a clearer view thread as well as the root of the Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW] thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven\'t read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn\'t in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the a clearer view posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you\'ll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims.  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie\'s essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course, you are more than welcome to do so.',0

1557,'  Well, I\'ve said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people\'s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can\'t always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn\'t objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn\'t matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don\'t think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.',0

I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham\'s bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John\'s position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John\'s position possibly needs to be reworked.      Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.',3
1561,' (excerpts from posting on this topic)    (I\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\'re not only in twilight.) :o)    Now my comments:   I\'d like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, getting away from it all (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. ',2
1562,' Good question.  I don\'t have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr doing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and is probably caused by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be  true to his or her self.  What is more important, being true to yourself or burying that truth within you in order to maintain peace in the family?  hard question, no good answer.',3

1566,': In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a : reach. Science has its basis in observable fact.   I\'d say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it\'s given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn\'t mean that the objective standard itself doesn\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of decent people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one\'s   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or \'stay in the closet\' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don\'t  want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in    his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\'s_will,_and_    not_let_God\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be    active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler, from Mein Kampf, trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can\'t conclude that he\'s an atheist,  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed \'truth\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\'t to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation, any claim that a passage \'means\' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal\'s Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\'s version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing is not true.  Suppose you\'re believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on  evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one\'s eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one\'s interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no cost.  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal\'s wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam\'s Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam\'s Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\'s  Razor.  In its original form, it said Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam\'s Razor, they generally express it  more generally, for example as Take the simplest solution.  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\'s Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it\'s good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and God does not play dice  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\'re cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that God does not play dice [with the universe].  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\'s refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: I believe in Spinoza\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium, published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In    The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...     It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.  The latter quote is from Albert Einstein: The Human Side, edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it\'s money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?, but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is (or was).  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book A Brief History of Time, explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor, we wouldn\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid (\'true\' or \'false\') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a Liar  Paradox.  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is This  sentence is false.  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\'t tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?   GB: I guess I\'m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.   RS: Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?   GB: No, I don\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.   RS: Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?   GB: Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I\'m just not       very high on atheists.  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in Free Enquiry magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle \'88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as one nation under God (Bush\'s phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?    EM: It\'s bullshit.    RS: What is bullshit?    EM: Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.    RS: Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.   EM: You\'re welcome.  After Bush\'s election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.

Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called Hell in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist\'s handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn\'t the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert    the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient    auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,    needs them not.       - James Madison, A Memorial and Remonstrance, 1785    I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of    the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.    Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!       - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson    History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people    maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of    ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will    always avail themselves for their own purpose.        - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813    I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or    requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely    above it.        - Benjamin Franklin, from Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion,         Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans\' Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949, vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it\'s hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation. ',0
1569,' This was known as *Journey to the Far Side of the Sun* in the United States and as *Doppelganger* in the U.K.  It was produced by the great team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (whose science was usually a bit better than this).  It may have been their first production using live actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows, such as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.  The astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL airliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to look at.',2
1570,'SSF is up for redesign again.  Let\'s do it right this time!  Let\'s step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF\'s 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF\'s pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life\'s adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat\'s technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.  ',2
1279,' From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an introduction to the article Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz.   \tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of \tthe world\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as \t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\'s \taggressive missionary program, covering more than one \thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world \tcountries. \t \tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and \tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict \tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly \treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of \ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief \tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion, \tpornography, sexual freedom, women\'s rights, and other, in \tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it \tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea. \t \tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy \tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western \tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft \tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family, \tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed \tgovernment officials. \t \tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by \tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had \tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill \tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he \thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of \tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written by \tthe commandment of God, claims that the ancient Hebrews \tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors \tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who \thave been baptized in the true church will be reunited \tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can \tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the \thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been \tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and \tas heretics by religious fundamentalists. \t \tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was \tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because \tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from \tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois, \twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham \tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over \tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further \twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City.  \tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of \tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice \tin nineteenth-century America. \t \tWhile other religions go back many centuries -- \tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism, \t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are \tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon \troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this \thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny \tis dangerous to the faith. \t \tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles \tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong \tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical \texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of \tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion \tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a \tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the \thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz \t  The article itself is super.',0

1576,'  See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it, but by your definition, it can\'t be shown.  And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However, it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of phyics.  It is less silly to talk about animals, as they have at least some free will.',0

This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter \'write2\' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you \'original\' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you \'selected\' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don\'t have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this.  There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this moment of silence shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer  being able taking note of it.)  A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant mainstream religion.  All that a moment of silence does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn\'t NEED it, to have a special place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the moment of silence it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.  Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians.  As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this moment of silence campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it\'s worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in making their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so.  If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you.  Give it up.',3

Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it\'s possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach?

1588,'  Atoms are not objective.  They aren\'t even real.  What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.  I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what we can _say_ about the physical world.',3

1590,'I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls Geode (rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside) or the ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.

1218,'        _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely       no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have       to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to       conventional Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching       by comets, it\'s got too many holes in it to count, but at       least it was a good try...     So you have a plausible model for GRB\'s at astronomical distances?  I don\'t have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)     Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star    hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for    implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of    models.  Hmm, the superbowl burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I\'ve read (and I haven\'t seen the papers, only the press) I\'d say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models     A paper on the possibility of GRB\'s in the Oort cloud just came    through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this     Here is the abstract of that paper.   ...       indicator to these events all possible sources which are       isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is       why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,       although there is no known mechanism for generating GRBs       from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that GRBs       originate in the solar cometary cloud       cannot be excluded until it is disproved.  This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no, anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference. That\'s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

The Islam I know states clearly that  \'there can be no coercion in matters of religion\'.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the Reciprocal System, is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.                      (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL            DATUM).                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson\'s Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal RECIPROCITY.                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\'s lack of a fancy PH.D. degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a unified field theory that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that epicycles, crystal spheres,            geocentricity, flat earth theory, etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\'s Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson\'s organization, THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE, and Editor of            their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY.  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   Super Collider BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super            Collider, in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific            value.                      Most physicists don\'t realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (mesons, hyperons, ALLEGED quarks, etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the Supercollider?!                                 Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum.                       In Larson\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove Einstein\'s General Theory of Relativity.                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than General Relativity can, by            INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity.  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of Special            Relativity, including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing            about this.]                            In regard to mass increases, it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\'s Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called Big Bang (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION, by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the 3-degree background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\'s success:            In his first book in 1959, THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE, Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the Cosmic Sector.  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by fusion.  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter, neutron            stars, black holes, etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode\'s Law.                         Black Hole FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black            holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole, and            concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original black holes.                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black            holes, etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, it is            clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser.  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\'s            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER, by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\'s book NOTHING BUT            MOTION] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.                            Note that in Larson\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the unit frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the unit rate).             (Unit velocity is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson\'s Theory.)  [I might have the above and            below labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\'s Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the unit frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            science (or physics, or astronomy, etc.), as well as            the scientific literature and the education systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

Ohhh, you want to put in FINE PRINT which says Thou shall do wonderous R&D rather than use off-the-shelf hardware? Sorry, didn\'t see that in my copy. Most of the Pournellesque proposals run along the lines of <some dollar amount> reward for <some simple goal>.    You go ahead and do your development, I\'ll buy off the shelf at higher cost (or even Russian; but I also assume that there\'d be some Buy US provos in there) and be camped out in the Moon while you are launching and assembling little itty-bitty payloads in LEO with your laser or gas gun.  And working out the bugs of assembly & integration in LEO.   Oh, hey, could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment?

1609,'Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration.  Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..   Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco-freaks or the protectionist..  Such fun we have in these interesting times..',2
1610,'   Is there any difference in saying   Absolute Truth exists, but some people think its a lie  and  Truth is relative ?  I think there is:  in both examples, the first statement is a fundamental disagreement between at least two people; the  second statement is agreed upon by all.  To put it another way, someone who says objective values exist does not agree that values are subjective.',3
1611,' I\'ve got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting).  My gripe about TIFF is that it\'s far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g., paint programs).  In a nutshell, I don\'t think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn\'t be TIFF anymore.  They keep trying to cut it back, but it\'s late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it, and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility.  That would probably make me happy.',1

1615,'  See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant if it is voluntary.  Why do you think this?  And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.   You are attaching too many things to the term moral, I think. Let\'s try this:  is it good that animals of the same species don\'t kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right?   Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do is either right nor wrong?    Those weren\'t arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort of mating ritual or whatnot.   Yes it was, but I still don\'t understand your distinctions.  What do you mean by consider?  Can a small child be moral?  How about a gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does the being need to be self aware?  What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don\'t you find the fact that they don\'t at all significant?',0
1616,'The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition\'s spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the Family Values positons of the \'92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson\'s organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino\'s Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a nonpolitical, Catholic businessmen\'s group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign\'s list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson\'s American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson\'s ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork.  In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization\'s quarterly newsletter, Rocco L. Martino, a Philadelphia business that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of our constitution.  Oh yes, the organization\'s national ecclesisatical advisor is Catholic politician Cardinal John J. O\'Connor of New York.',3

1619,'Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don\'t want to see the FAQ, add \'Frequently Asked Questions\' to your KILL file for this group (if you\'re not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you\'re out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you\'re on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit Subject: lines, especially if you\'re taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth \t100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST \tnot SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all \treferences.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\'re \tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail \tor article), state your institution, etc. Don\'t assume the \t\'reply\' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\'t post what everyone \twill get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: \tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals \t(use carriage returns).

The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven\'t given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.

In college you are constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else\'s ideas from reaching you.

1628,'Hi there,  I\'ve made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They\'re intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I\'ll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I\'ve found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a virtual screen, put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I\'ve also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick\'n\'dirty(tm) demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows.

There have been bad habits of mine that I\'ve decided to put forth the effort to break, and I\'ve done so; there have been other bad habits that I\'ve decided are not worth the effort to break.  It\'s my choice, either way.  I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.  I don\'t always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.  Do *you* have any habits you can\'t break?  Why not?   I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you\'ve probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion. Are you unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Quran?  If that\'s different, then how is it different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?   Of COURSE not.  That\'s disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans; that\'s one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.   No.  I don\'t insult people.  Period.  It\'s not in my nature, and it\'s not something that I want to do, either.   Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is in the getting there!   We don\'t start out perfect; we\'ve got to strive to be something better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I\'ll accept the praise for them.  There have been times in my life when I\'ve made mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.   I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don\'t *always* turn back, there\'s no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.   And you don\'t have a clue about what I\'m saying, either.  Open your eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I\'m not just spouting off empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.   Huh?  You\'re going WAY off the track here.  I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to definite things she\'s done for me, and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her, face-to-face.  You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can\'t even convince me that it exists!   If any god dangles \'heaven\' before me like a carrot, promising untold pleasures to me if I\'ll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once, then I would choose \'hell\'.  I can *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful it is.  Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way: Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the others.

I mean, after a few hours, it closes, and nothing\'s different except that you\'re a few dollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park doesn\'t do you any good at all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?  The answer is that you think it\'s fun.  You play the skee-ball over and over because you\'d like to get better at it, even though you\'re not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it\'s an thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out of you.  In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don\'t intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D   So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don\'t you see?  I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I can\'t similarly apply to Santa Claus.   I can\'t do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than just your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to be significant to me.  Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without invoking them?

Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed  some unusual  data after working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   The Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur., reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair, first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late 1950\'s.  The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn\'t want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his skull., notes Gillow in his report. There are whole  laboratories in the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400\'s is now scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats. Gillow is quick to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.  When it becomes time to replace the pope, says Gillow, The old pope and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  butt heads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  The victor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir boys.   P.',0

It discusses the forms of kleros (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various meanings of kleros (eg: plot of land, and inheritance), but mentions nothing about CHORION or burial plot.

It is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:     I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus confused kleros, the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of land discussed.  In actuality it is chorion, which is the last word Acts 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so I cannot report as to the nuances of the word.

DB... and Mr DeCenso also replied:     Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such drek convincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of This is what Bullinger believed, not necessarily what I believe. So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)   MY REPLY... One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS, I will clearly distinguish them from now on.   DB... Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.   MY REPLY... Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper.  I\'m glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.   DB... It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough:     But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let\'s see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don\'t count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.   MY REPLY... Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don\'t mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas\' death, as you claim.  But we\'ll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the reward of iniquity in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew\'s PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas\' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose\'s explanation of Judas\' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew\'s and Peter\'s accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven\'t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here\'s what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to find Tony Rose\'s eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David Joslin\'s.   _____________________________________________________________________   Here, you discredit Tony\'s explanation based on what you deem too heavy for the passages.  But you haven\'t addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it\'s a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn\'t tell me it didn\'t happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child\'s psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is begging the question, if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute\'s show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we\'ll see in an OT passage I\'ll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it\'s synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.   DB... Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.   MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave.   DB... Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^   MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] So it\'s OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony\'s position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?   Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their interpretation of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died.  Although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember, that\'s the first criteria we must examine.   DB... This included:       The Biblical Knowledge Commentary by Woodward and Zuck   MY REPLY... Which I own.  It\'s a good source of commentary info.  But not inerrant.   DB...     The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible by Laydon     The one volume Bible Commentary by J R Dunelow     Word meanings of the Testament Ralph Earl     The Abingdon Bible Commentary published by Abingdon     Harpers Bible Commentary by William Neal      (Actually I could have presented many more as well)   MY REPLY... I appreciate your doing this research, Dave.  Maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth study.   DB... In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Greek word apagchw(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.   MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] No you can\'t only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it\'s only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father\'s tomb.             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel hanged himself [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, and died.  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means hang oneself.   DB... But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] Reputable?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can\'t be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony\'s exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas\' death (taking into account several criteria), I\'ve recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood. And they consulted together and bought with them the potter\'s field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he went and hanged himself. Luke however, in Acts, tells us that and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter\'s speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas\' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas\' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let\'s look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? You see to it!   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter\'s field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...Then he...went and hanged himself. Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms: \'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it\'; and, \'Let another take his office.\'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas\' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the two accounts of Judas\' death is this...Matthew doesn\'t necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas hanged himself, but he didn\'t specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas\' `death\'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it\'s possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars\' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can\'t assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew\'s version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  The Biblical Knowledge Commentary suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn\'t explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn\'t explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________   DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter\'s field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter\'s field came from).   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.).  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of iniquity, and then immediately discusses *the* reward of iniquity, it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren\'t we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry. ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms: \'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it\'; and, \'Let another take his office.\'   Notice that in verse 16, the word iniquity is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages of iniquity - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the wages of iniquity are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).

1226,'[ . . .]  I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of right and wrong (or correct/incorrect or true/false) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is right (correct, true, veridical) or wrong (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\'t be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the rightness of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the correctness of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold different moral values (feelings).',0

1102,'   Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics  that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few  important parameters.  The polygons are all convex.  They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)  I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons.  This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.  The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small  number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.  Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons.     It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms. If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a  asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be. ',1
1653,' <Moral Driver distinctions deleted>   Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge and an object. The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven\'t attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don\'t think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen \'amplitudes\', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can\'t define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\'s Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?.

I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini\'s ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad. This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis. But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.',0

1661,'[Please, note the Newsgroups.]  Recent discussion about XV\'s problems were held in some newsgroup. Here is some text users of XV might find interesting. I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even you so my articles a while ago.  I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fine program XV is that it is worth of improving. (I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)  Any misundertanding of mine is understandable.   Juhana Kouhia   ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  Note that \'xv\' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also, there\'s three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too.   This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.   IMHO, it is design error of \'xv\'; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. There\'s two errors:   -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of    original 24bit should be a special case   -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer    -- the main case should be that \'xv\' quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases    in saving the image, if at all)   ==clip==  ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design. It is error in design. It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that.  As matter of fact, I\'m sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. That were not done and now we have  -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)  -the program has human interface errors.  Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.  [ ..deleted.. ]  ==clip==  Some new items follows.  ==clip==  I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant.  If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.  I don\'t know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no. So, use of XV\'s -best24 option is not very good idea.  I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- I\'m sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I can say nothing about it.)  ==clip==  ==clip==  Some minor bugs in human interface are:  Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.  Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is completed. Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when I\'m writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.  In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first and then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet. I suggest of adding an \'apply\' button to update the exchanges done.',1
1662,'  Really>`?   No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don\'t need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone\'s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).',0

1664,'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its current directory.  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the dithering, again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\'t performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? ',1

In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published The Man Who Sold the Moon, which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with SCHWARZENEGGER painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold\'s latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense.

1681,' I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the  operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded.  I don\'t remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was  asked about that very matter: Why can\'t we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going?  His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular, however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just as he had benefited from his predicessor\'s funding choices, he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.

1684,'    That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated Interplanetary Network was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say It\'s somewhere in the field of view.).  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the  sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didn\'t mean to, though.

1687,' In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don\'t have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.

As published in US Industrial Outlook 1993  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15\%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  Space Business Indicators in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10\% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 \% per year  through the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request launch on demand  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/Spacelifter program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all ELV upgrade programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed Spacelifter  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC GO-AHEAD    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a Star Wars spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95\%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25\% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 \% over today\'s average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the Aerokosmos  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the Severkosmos,  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  \'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as the main  alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10\% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10\% of the  satellite\'s communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is Asiasat- 2, but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based Asiasat program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s  aerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely made in Korea.   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+\%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....

1697,'Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a good thing by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called The Gay Agenda and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don\'t understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN EX-GAY SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\'s homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians a way out of the homosexual death-style through prayer.  I\'d like to give the award back, Caligiuri now laughs, I\'m no longer deserve it.   Caligiuri\'s eight year involvement with the national ex-gay movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  There\'s no reality in it, he says, I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality, explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that about 80\% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.   Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time, says Lisa Seeley, a former redeemed lesbian who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.   It\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior, says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. But it\'s really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  I was really drunk, he recalls, and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  He had another man there with him, Caligiuri recalls.  I thought at this time, \'If this is what being gay is about, I don\'t want to be this way anymore.   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\'s gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services, Caligiuri says, so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we\'d preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, They\'ll do anything to reach these people.   David used to go on radio and say really stupid things, recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.   Caligiuri\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  They were relieved, he recalls. They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a \'reformed\' gay person.   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  By the time I appeared on Sally\'s show, I\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.  When he wasn\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other reformed homosexuals.   I didn\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another, Caligiuri says.  We\'d go to conferences in other cities, and we\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.   By the time he appeared on \'AM Philadelphia\' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\'s host asked him if he ever acted on temptation, his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri\'s duplicity began to take it\'s toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  I was too sick to go to church, he explains.  The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry\'s doors.  I\'d convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people, he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (I\'m interest- ed in belief systems that aren\'t judgemental.), considering romance (But not with a CHristian!), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes, he says.  I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.  ---end article---  Caligiuri\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of \'ex-gay\' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian Lazarus Project of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as Love In Action and others, who either once claimed to have been reformed or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sin through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for \'suicide\' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\'s _Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\'s _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.',3

1701,'      I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I\'ve articulated it above_ (which may not be the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam.  So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from  the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur\'an.     In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.      Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur\'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly proscribed by the Qur\'an.    Alaikum Wassalam ',0

1340,'   Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it payload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.   They where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. A resurected Saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored) which is five times cheaper than Shuttle.      Allen  ',2

1713,'  That\'s right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological burdens, too.   Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism, they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually believing in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you originated it.',0
1714,'Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.  How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a  set of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that  have their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What\'s the best way to realize that face is flipped, and should have it\'s points re-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized that the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a 2d polygon.  I\'d like something for 3d data.  Any hints, tips, references would be appreciated.  Steve',1

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson\'s. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don\'t have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there\'s a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: \tEdition Belvedere Co. Ltd., \t00196 Rome Italy, \tPiazzale Flaminio, 19 \tTel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can\'t be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There\'s a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: An Introduction to Ray Tracing, in   Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD, ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  Displays on Display column of IEEE CG&A Jan \'87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell\'s teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep \'87 in Jim Blinn\'s column Jim Blinn\'s Corner describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you\'re advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here\'s a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles\' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model\'s distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\'t normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\'m not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. \'ice\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\'s a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it\'s an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\'m not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\'ve   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\'s a   freebie if you want it    My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\'s mostly astronomical   image processing which I\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.    FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.   iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization)       /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI    Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it\'s public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software. A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   tar archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The PCI software consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI   database disk file.  The Tape I/O package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the PCI database file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5), and   God only knows what all else -- there\'s a LOT.  I don\'t have and don\'t   use these, so can\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters, read from   a common parameter file which must be (in VMS anyway) in your default   directory.  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\'s   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls raw) data from tape, in a number of different   interleave orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry\'s CT2T format, would probably (I haven\'t tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It\'s worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to   contain not only raster (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI database).    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be overkill   in your case; it seems designed for the very high end   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\'t suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\'s   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\'re interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

1731,'      Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the \'30\'s.  For much of the \'20\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It\'s important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd\'s _America_.  When it\'s time to railroad, you railroad.     Not off the top of my head; I\'ll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator\'s Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked.

It\'s appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type archie as username. To get help type \'help\'. You can get \'xarchie\' or \'archie\', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. \'Xarchie\' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and \'archie\' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject help to archie account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify archie as the host name and archie as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying I can\'t FTP, could someone mail this to me?  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm, and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie\'s help. Don\'t overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC\'s FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word \'help\'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL\'s postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there\'s BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line \'help\' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called The Graphics BBS.  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

Scene description languages ==============================  NFF ---   Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some   procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects   floating in various FTP sites. There\'s also a previewer written in   HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there\'s one written in VOGLE, so you can   use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.   (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)  OFF ---   Object file format, from DEC\'s Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com). [ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,  I\'ll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]    Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this   service, send a message with a Subject: line containing only the word   help and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.   [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There\'s an OFF   previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It\'s a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor\'s lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter\'s Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.  RenderMan ---------   Pixar\'s RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.  ==========================================================================  8. Solids description formats =============================  a. EEC\'s ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a   neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and   solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided   Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)  b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid   models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987   For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at   NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325   and the cost is $100.   This standard is not available in electronic format.  c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only   the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.   The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get   more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov   and putting the line \tsend index   in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.    The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working   on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,   both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.   Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

1742,' [Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]   The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically.    For several reasons.  Vertical landings don\'t require miles of runway and limit noise pollution.  They don\'t require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren\'t quite that simple.   Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you\'re learning.   The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings are also not very comfortable.

1744,'  Yes I fully agree with that, but is it I don\'t believe gods exist, or I believe no gods exist? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka) pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word believe to mean.  Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism, at least according to the FAQ:  # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. # Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is # often referred to as the weak atheist position, and the latter as strong # atheism. #  # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  Weak # atheism is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  Strong # atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a \'controversial\' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.

If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community, Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet and Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can\'t find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    Alt.Atheism FAQ:.  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are help and    send atheism/index.  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed; it\'s not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.    it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. ',0

1753,'  The company was probably Public Missiles, Inc of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it\'s not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an F motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I\'ve been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That\'s another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that\'s one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. ',2

In The Name Of  Allah, The Compassionate, The Merciful     He is who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth  to make it supreme over all religion:  and sufficient is Allah as a Witness.  Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are firm against the unbelievers and merciful among each other.  You will see them bowing and prostrating  themselves, seeking Allah\'s grace and His pleasure.  Their mark is on their face the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in the Torah and Indgil.

As a supplement to them, we will merely show here in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great truth.     FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that are apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows, surely the One who knows will speak, since He will speak, surely He will speak to those who have consciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW),  who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest  character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah\'s blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts.

1758,' I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don\'t think it\'s very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that\'s because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)',3

1775,' Hi Noel,  I\'ve made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts, triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic 3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.  The problem I\'m currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code example of how to do it.  Another way to do the bartman may be  - TGA2POV - A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.    Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript   previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,   the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it\'s still open   on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.  Example:  object {    union {       height_field { gif abp2.gif }       height_field { gif abp2.gif scale <1 -1 1>}    }    texture {       Glass    }    translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center    rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards    scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker    translate <0 2 0>            // final placement }   abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ABP black on white in Times-Roman 256 points.

1777,' The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years. See the discussion of high-power rocketry in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren\'t doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it\'s not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it\'s basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.',2

1783,' What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by omnipotent that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean being all-powerful and not being able to do anything/everything.  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily omnipotent.  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do whatever it wanted. The US would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.  Regards,',0

1785,' Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life, Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above  the rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.

If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must  leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.  In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don\'t affect the genral population and don\'t come into direct conflict with state  laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving) etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.

1792,'Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]        Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations, since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations, in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than public relations, in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie The Last Action Hero.  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.   This is being disputed, since the launch is a commercial launch and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL BILLBOARDS    Orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in The Man Who Sold the Moon.  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the Eiffel II project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.

1798,'Let me begin by saying I think this is the world\'s first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become  common.  The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\'s accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.  For example,  Story of Adam and Eve: Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide  in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden. (There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered God.)  Traditional Philosophy: 1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\'s OK. This is why married women usually didn\'t work until recent decades. 2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler  and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without  question by ordinary people, who can\'t make decisions for themselves.  Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy: They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their Father said to.  Being forced to leave the  Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.  Lessons from Traditional Interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read welfare) is ideal.  Get- ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment. 3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad. 4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and  should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for  themselves. 5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.  1990\'s philosophy: 1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless named Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown. 2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people  (binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.  Interpretation of events based on current philosophy: They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them- selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were  REWARDED by being allowed into the real world.  Lessons from new interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read welfare) is at best a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good. 4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and alter or abolish bad governments.  They should think for themselves. 5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children  without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves).  I have tentatively named this new philosophy The Church of Eveism because Eve\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\'s first good decision, instead of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek  knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it  until it was actively sought.  ---End serious discussion.

1825,'   # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don\'t agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur\'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic.       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing color to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven\'t already) or THE DRAGON\'S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The unseen is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\'s okay to say      well, Satan is just metaphorical, but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn\'t a bar to evil.  Let\'s      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are evil.  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

1833,'   Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When graphed, these define the \'flight envelope\' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn\'t fall out of the sky.  Hence, \'pushing the envelope\' becomes \'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope\'.   Note that the envelope isn\'t precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is \'push the envelope\' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, \'pushing back\' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be \'pushed\' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the \'early\' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.

To disobey God after KNOWing that God is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable. Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to  God\'s chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just for a few chosen people.

Interestingly, there are those who say that existence exists is one of the indubitable statements possible.

We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where we cross someone\'s border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation invades the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)

The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be bad and unconscionable.  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with  the national defense.

The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder ',2

1866,' (WEBSTER:  myth:  a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.)  How does that qualify? Indeed, it\'s almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I\'ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as accepted uncritically, especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don\'t meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone knows that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you\'ve read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn\'t make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that\'s clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone knows your alleged god\'s alleged existance.   1) No, they don\'t have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that\'s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn\'t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn\'t generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn\'t exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren\'t.   No, human reason hasn\'t always come back to the existance of God; it has usually come back to the existance of god. In other words, it doesn\'t generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn\'t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in God only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it\'s reasonableness certainly doesn\'t merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.

1875,'Archive-name: space/astronaut Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $  HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT      First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA     announcement.      Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\'s probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\'re better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle mission     specialist.      If you aren\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA\'s problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can\'t, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA\'s image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first.      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\'t make it the first time.

It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\'s     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology, \tMedical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological \tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:  \tNASA Johnson Space Center \tAstronaut Selection Office \tATTN: AHX \tHouston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters.

1879,'  The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but I thought I\'d hop on, anyway...  What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer\'s fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to choose evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer\'s free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer\'s fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?',0

1882,' I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK\'s R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I\'ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :   \t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail \t\t\t-------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a \'conventional\' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

1904,'Archive-name: space/net Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $  NETWORK RESOURCES  OVERVIEW      You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of     computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In     general, however, systems connected to \'the net\' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special \'servers\'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet \'netnews\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     \'group name\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called \'sci.space.news\', \'sci.space\', \'sci.space.shuttle\', \'sci.astro\',     and \'talk.politics.space\'. Contributors \'post\' submissions (called     \'articles\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade).

1324,'Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                           The Next Step                                    The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase  Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act.                               There is a small group of activists in southern California  who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon.         Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert  for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993.         All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown\'s office. As more is known, it will be passed on.         However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we\'re out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose.                             This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources  Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons\' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson\'s staff review a bill.         If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians.         If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society).',2

1907,' I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder, I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select \'EXPORT\' on the main file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions, of course, in which case you\'re on your own!!!  Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time) did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!  The QCR-Z also couldn\'t handle grad-fill over grad-fill - so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the shape of the object being filled!!!  Of course, if the recorder isn\'t a QCR, you can ignore all this and feel suitably :-)',1

1094,'qpalo@digi.lonestar.org (Gerry Palo)   For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and misleading innuendos as part of their exposes.  A recent book on cults I picked up by a Christian author quite simply mixed in all non-Christian religions (except the Jews) and various New Age groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.   Given the record of American Christianity, any group that falls into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically into the Inquisition business.  It is an unavoidable affliction of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth (tm). And let\'s not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod Lutherans, and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers.

1915,'   Well they don\'t export anywhere near 50\% of their GNP. Mexico\'s perhaps but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10\% mark. Similar to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share of GNP as does the United States (14\% I think off hand. Always likely to be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious if you thought about it.   It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but they couldn\'t live without imports for any longer than six months if that.   Too true! But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.  Joseph Askew ',2
1916,'   I think that you are changing the meaning of values here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word value above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as objective values.  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word values is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will be a good beginning. ',3

1920,'[deletions]  If this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.  Whether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or not, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words.  It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that? You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support threatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.  This is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.  You, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone, whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the miscreants, or whatever, short of physical force.

1924,' Yep, that\'s pretty much it. I\'m not a Jew but I understand that this is the Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries fall, though.  As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).  The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).   The trouble with all of this is that we don\'t really know what the created in His image means. I\'ve heard a number of different opinions on this and have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors unashamedly!) As to living by Christ\'s example, we know very little about Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians. Revelation aside, one can only know Christ second-hand or worse.  This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.   No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told the child that it is wrong. Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar (where there are no children). The wrongness here is if the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.  David.  --- On religion:',3

1926,'    {Description of External Tank option for SSF redesign deleted}   Yo Ken, let\'s keep on-top of things! Both the External Tank and Wingless Orbiter options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles, and building a station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today\'s Times).  Option A - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses Bus-1, a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\'s      qualified for STS and ELV\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A Power Station Capability is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option B - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option B team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option A). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options A and B.  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A Two Fault Tolerance Capability is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.',2

1258,' Well, it\'s not that simple -- you\'re in Earth\'s magnetic field, and you don\'t generate electricity -- but it can be done.   The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say propel rather than power, the answer is sort of.)  Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth\'s magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this.  However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn\'t coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however.  What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.  If you want more information, trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion, tether applications, and magsails.   No.  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around dragless.',2

However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I  suspect.  I\'m not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindbergh\'s flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the  equivalent amount of direct investment would.

1943,'Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40\% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3\% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3\% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3\% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15\% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.  Dani Eder ',2

1201,'Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling between some software cracks...   [Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an  apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn\'t actually  have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn\'t matter to what  follows]  I don\'t know whether I\'m quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back to current affairs,   Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you will, known (according to Umar Khan) to Every Muslim school boy and girl, and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.   Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing the actor Gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took. Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened.  It\'s somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer, consider Salman Rushdie\'s children\'s book Haroun and the Sea of Stories for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific storyteller -- works with existing story lines.   No.  Muhammad\'s [Mahound\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story, and there\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\'s intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and satanic), though he doesn\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied (in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:       *Not my voice* I\'d never know such words I\'m no classy speaker     never was never will be but this isn\'t my voice it\'s a Voice.       Mahound\'s eyes open wide, he\'s seeing some kind of vision,     staring at it, oh, that\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He\'s     seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don\'t     know, can\'t say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my     mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.       Being God\'s postman is no fun, yaar.       Butbutbut: God isn\'t in this picture.       God knows whose postman I\'ve been.  It\'s ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan? Or something else?  The answer is not given.  To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation, but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very existence of a newsgroup named alt.atheism raises the same questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is the real relevance.  If Rushdie\'s mild fictional exploration is filth and lies, and he asked for what he got, are we next on the fatwa list?

1950,' For the purpose of a contest, I\'d bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it\'d need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don\'t remember the name of this magazine.

But I do _not_ agree that things are \'inherently\' or \'absolutely\' immoral; they are labeled \'immoral\' each for its own good reason, and if the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.  [...]        No it doesn\'t. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another story altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence to moral absolutism (of a flavour).  [...]        You\'re saying morality is what\'ll keep society alive and kicking. It is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and neither are their moralities.         Similar != identical.

Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\'s ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

1970,'I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.  Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the accompanying documentation:                                 DMPEG V1.0                         Public Domain MPEG decoder                             by Stefan Eckart   0. Features ===========  DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:    - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard    (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)   - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display   - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)   - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale   - color-space selection   - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required   - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)   - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for    VGA and many Super-VGAs  ...  4. Technical information ========================  The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn\'t it?), which turned out to be faster than a \'fast\' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).  Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.  Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas.  ... ',1

1988,'McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X          HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon Pete Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend, he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the better, faster, cheaper approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a build a little, test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents\' time.          The key is management, Worden said. SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.          SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. This is the direction we\'re going to have to go, said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s Democratic chairman. Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t sustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further. Joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team, Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. Let\'s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. On very large ventures, companies put in seed money, said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\' senior vice president for space systems. You need strong government investments.          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will expand the envelope of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a pitch-over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles Pete Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.',2

The issue of satan\'s spirit-origin (and of those who followed him) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non- related scriptures.

In this single posting of yours, I\'ve seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about the only true God, whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring. It doesn\'t address any issue raised, but #  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read #  something into the Bible, doesn\'t change what the Bible teaches.  Sigh.  What the Bible teaches?  Or: what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co.?  I respect the former, I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).  (...)  #  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of #  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \'official doctrine.\' I don\'t #  think that it matters if McConkie\'s views were canon. That is not the #  issue.  Were McConkie\'s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this #  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may #  certainly be.  The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of official doctrine is obviously very important.  McConkie\'s views have been controversial (e.g. The Seven Deadly Heresies has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation).  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to as McConkie\'s Bible in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\'s books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

2002,'      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we\'re seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) \tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda\'s bursters. \tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is the edge of the Universe ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.  \tIf we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they\'d actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it\'s  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

2003,'    I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--\'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics\'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.  Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the fact that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as Shape Shifter than Space Lifter.  We didn\'t spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)       I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s and 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]',2
2011,'ZOROASTRIANISM SAN JOSE, CA, USA Monday April 5, 1993 San Jose Mercury News, Page 1      [Reproduced without permission]  _3,700-year tradition still glows -             \'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion\'_  By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer     HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States - dedicated to one of the world\'s most ancient religions.     With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     There is a fear - a real fear, too, said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. We have one generation to do it or to die.     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where historical sites are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it\'s their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     It\'s important to have an identity, said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  It\'s important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.     For Zoroastrians, there\'s much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.     So it\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on good deeds has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\'s dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called fire worshippers, they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book, Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year\'s celebration of the prophet\'s birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     The good things in life are not forbidden, Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  People eat the fruit, Tarapore said.  It\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  This is all new for us, too, one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people\'s religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     When I first heard about this religion, he said, I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.     People who don\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\'s the difference with the lower animals?',3

NASA is directly descended from the NACA, with space added in.  You\'ll notice that I didn\'t mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at what\'s now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don\'t change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It\'s true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)  Phil> Egad! I\'m disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base can\'t do.  ',2

2019,' Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there -- the Moon\'s gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.  Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon\'s own gravitational field is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.',2

2021,'    My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some truth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.    Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is a prime cause (in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying it is the prime cause or the only cause, just a prime cause -- i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century.',0

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!  But what is h? The cutoff function h is defined as follows:  h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1       = 1    if   s > 1       = -1   if   s < 1  As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year. Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles. Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below the arctic circle. ',2

11,'I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,    an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.    Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.     The following is the relevant sections from the man page.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)  NAME    bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations  DESCRIPTION   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.    As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the   many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The   SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size.    As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of   input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).    Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image.  FEATURES    Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,    the processed image will be displayed.    Current features include    o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing     and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color.    o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with     the option of subpixel sampling.    o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text     strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in TeX(1), e.g., $lpha$small$eta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.    o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.    o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished     rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-     lability of graphical histograms of the image.    o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-     gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,     PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions     independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle).    o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-     to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.    o Performs histogram equalization.    o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of     arbitrary order.    o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.    o Cuts and pastes across images.    o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.    o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images. (SlideShow)    o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities     or as an intensity vs. distance plot.    o Performs image type conversions.    o Converts image formats.    o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).    o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it.    o Modify an individual pixel\'s RGB values.    o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra.    o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).   SUPPORTED FORMATS       o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS       o  JPEG(JFIF) format       o  CompuServ GIF       o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.       o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)       o  TIFF       o  PostScript(Write only)  Hardware requirements: ---------------------------------------------------------------    Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.  Where to get it: ---------------------------------------------------------------    anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z    where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73     Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking  Acknowledgement: ---------------------------------------------------------------    JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups\'s library Version 4.    FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.    Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.  ---------------------------------------------------------------   Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical   kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it   (and you will like it).',1

These 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in many places (see below)  --  Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears in the Archive-name line at the top of the article. This FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]  There\'s a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field  --  The inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the Subject 4: Mail servers )  --  The Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list. It\'s got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of indexing.  --  Another place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files. For more info contact Robert E. Maas <rem@btr.com>  --  Yet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH (Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:  interactive:   telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as info. Move to the   info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the   00index file by typing / and the word to look for.   You may then just read the FAQ in the faqs directory, or decide   to fetch it by one of the following methods.  ftp:   login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and   enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a   password.  \tcd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings  mail:   send e-mail to  RFC-822:    archive-server@nic.switch.ch X.400:   /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/  Enter \'help\' in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information is required in the subject header line.   1. ARCHIE =========  The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for requested files. It\'s appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type archie as username. To get help type \'help\'. You can get \'xarchie\' or \'archie\', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. \'Xarchie\' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and \'archie\' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject help to archie account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify archie as the host name and archie as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying I can\'t FTP, could someone mail this to me?  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm, and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie\'s help. Don\'t overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC\'s FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word \'help\'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL\'s postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called The Graphics BBS.  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

13,' Indeed so; it\'s at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible.  It is possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced by the Earth\'s rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest- without-oxygen feasible.

24,'This discussion on objective seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the recent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is subjective and that even atom are subjective. This is getting a bit silly and the word objective is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the definition of objective which has been already presented:    objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as      distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.     3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on     observable phenomenon.  The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective.  Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though that observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the point of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively good; I will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective.   Now some examples things which are objective:  A D-12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt. There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks  ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.  Good on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn\'t seem to have an existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined good).  We cannot quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag full of good).  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word good an objective meaning, e.g.  good has been used to denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see strength and etc, as necessarily good (eg: strength inspired by Naziism  is not generally viewed as good).   As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of the Golden Rule, which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a manner you won\'t like.  This is verifiable; when you get in someone\'s face, they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can at times, ignore that form of the Golden Rule without fear of reprisal.  Now as to whether this enforcing of morality is good or bad, is quite subjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical existence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a morality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such morality.   One other thing to notice, objective is many times used as synonymous with true and/or absolute, and subjective sometimes has the connotation of false and/or relative. Tain\'t necessarily so.  For instance, when a conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be both objective and false.  As to absolute, it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean that all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either absolutist, or true. For instance, there are some theists who are specifically absolutist in their morality, even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a gut feeling or hunch), to investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence.   \t\t\t\tLater,  \t\t\t\tDave Butler',3

26,'-*----   No.  It follows from the fact that most Christians\' choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some right interpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was Michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but regardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point of contention between Michael and myself.   I have argued -- beyond Michael\'s claims -- that the Christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a wide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their most important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that there is some right interpretation *unless* there is a way to determine what that right interpretation is.  It is the lack of an objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that puts the force behind the line I argue.   There are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently broad range of color, that I can find a few that support my example.     In my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity hold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have called conservative must also interpret, but they do not recognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and importance of this.   I recognize that Michael is part of the tradition.  But what does it tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry Fallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon? Not very much!    I think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian scripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his political stances.  That one should love one\'s neighbor is a  purely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance  for homosexuality is *not*.  As to these political stances, they are often at odds with what is commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I  suspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other hand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these  political stances become most influential when presented to  those who need them most.)  -*----  Having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I doubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!',3

28,'In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs. One is a C program that will perform a morph between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there  must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is  appreciated.',1
29,'isaackuo@skippy.berkeley.edu (Isaac Kuo) states in reply to deleted article about no-knock searches, arrests    In general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence, like drugs, which can be flushed down the toilet.  They are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber.  If there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands up.  If the suspect does not come out tear gas will be used.   comment on the BD omitted    It is not a method to apprehend criminals.   It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way.  It is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room and they don\'t know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself.    Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.   Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they are arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea bargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals aren\'t aware that they are cops.  No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not committed any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.  The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called for.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could have surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet. ',3

51,'  Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.  Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.  Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.   Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel.

55,' This is one of those yes, but things. It\'s true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube, but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily, though it\'s straight-on compressive strength is high, and it\'s torsional  resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member,  there\'s no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature. Tree roots  are an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases.   Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don\'t think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I don\'t know much about panda thumbs, so I\'ll ask is it opposable?   Well I won\'t say flat out that they can\'t be intelligent, but I\'ll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don\'t think it\'s likely. First let me say that when I say intelligent I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  it\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\'s certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien.  Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\'s room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there\'s little selection pressure for such brains. Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\'t rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.  Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it\'s internal heat is rapidly lost due to it\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it\'s time and energy feeding won\'t have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\'s heat production  because it\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.  I\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it\'s activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity.  Gary',2

1115,'  I disagree.  In the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own irrationality.  The individual\'s belief in some dogmatic religion is a  symptom of that irrationality.   Atheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one\'s religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may be non-religious was a secondary point.    As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.  Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma: skepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that  wonderful little creature known as the theory.  Many of us believe in the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this  theory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it makes more  sense than...?  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.    Well, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.    Ideally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge that scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some scientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof  for the theory.  Remember cold fusion?    Not really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome. My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was in Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up), and the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the number of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the number of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and you will see my point. ',0

60,'John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:   * The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *  *  treated as a matter of faith. -- Francis Hitching                     *    I have a few points to make about the above posting.      1. Science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either     real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)     experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive     confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike     (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to     follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests     that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they     are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and this may not be your real intent.      2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his     statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the     quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.     Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context     and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate     scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may     not be your real intent.      3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of     evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one     line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that     disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate     claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck     proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond     of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not     actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.      4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack     on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on     science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the     fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long     ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and     irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.   Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:   * Neither I, nor Webster\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *    I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (The Neck of the Giraffe).  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution (the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a non sequitur (i.e. the conclusion does not follow). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]    Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was titled `Giraffe\' sticks scientific neck out too far.  Excerpts include :    Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.  He goes after Darwin like Mark   Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and   pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.  He suggests   a mystical `organizing principle\' of life, using the similarity of organs   in different creatures as evidence [sic].    Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\'t surprise me much.  It\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e. he only posted a quote). ',0

62,'Another article that fell between the cracks:   As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.  Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven\'t found any...  Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles. Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is No Martyrs for a Lie: i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don\'t even know how or where they died, we certainly don\'t have this information.  (By the way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.

Replacement components (WFPC II, COSTAR, gyros, solar panels, and probably a few others), all sorts of tools, EVA equipment, and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can.  This should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved the highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date.  And HST is now in a lower  orbit.

For one, your claim that everyone senses it #is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often. #And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it #is there unless evidence against it has been found.  I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\'s a good point, and I\'m thinking about it. #  #Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know, #therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process, #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological #claim, you have to prove it.  Nonsense.  My trick is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so  does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore  that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.  Now get this:  really is better is an idealisation, a fictional model, in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model. It may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  trick, to wit:  I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person I ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B, or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B, then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing more can be said.    I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that  a supermajority\'s carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorist\'s - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion.  #>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not #>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by #>#others. #> #>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively #>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this #>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence #>against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense). #> #It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to #judgements is absolute. And as long as you don\'t provide evidence for #that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to #believe your hypothesis.  I\'ve done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to  answer jon\'s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning.  #Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective, #you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes #above look quite misleading.  Not really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently of humans?  You\'ll be hard pressed to find any that isn\'t logically equivalent when applied to values.  #>An analogous set of premises would be: #> #>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest #>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance #>            of the estate, and down the Malahide road. #> #>Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my #>            which is much closer. #> #>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my #>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim, #>using premises which are logically no different. #> #  #No. Morals are a matter of belief so far.

To the North Pole!          On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union\'s mighty PROTON      rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan      Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe      for the planet Venus.           Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing     yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the     planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic     VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core     was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of     propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by     the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels     were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large     amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The     dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger      to properly transmit this information to Earth.           Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed     the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)     POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a     terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by      the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\'     surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).           The Soviet probes\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over     the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects      no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the     VENERAs\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations      made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the      island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern     pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or      PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially      interesting geological features worthy of investigation.          On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330      million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,      VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a      polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around      the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA      16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\'      first polar-circling spacecraft.          Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20      for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north     pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers      (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.       The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over      the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back      to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took      eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions      in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers      (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.          VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more     complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,      mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,      many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the      last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean      surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the      largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids      would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)      across, due to Venus\' very dense atmosphere.          There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists     on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\'      owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the      summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest      mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American      scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell      was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of Ishtar Terra.            In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about     Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later     in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar     (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-     nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be      called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan      (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even      finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet      probes maintained that distinction.          Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted     next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the      Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\'s     temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about     five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few     locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating      current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds      over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)      lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty      kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees      warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.          When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were      plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at      more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to      pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control     gas to perform the operation.            VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving      the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six      hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an      atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.          Venus by Balloon          For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting      target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\'s mantle of      air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of      the French space agency Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)     had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint      French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,      late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.          When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,      the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full      views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe      since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.          The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named     VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei     being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft      have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one      celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.            This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to      the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.     Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from     the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists      around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such      bodies which actually come close to Earth.            Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar      system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall      in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice      and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar      encounter.          The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and     Japan\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not     wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a     close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical     GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the      comet, while Japan\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and      SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.           Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet     from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel     powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget     cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to     make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of      data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter      and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor      John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.          The Soviets\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building     an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify     their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an      advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,     the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of      the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the      U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.      The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the      location of the comet\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive      in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.          As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA     1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander     making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the     upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers     (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released     by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)     altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had     successfully arrived.           One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was     pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a     diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen     meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as     an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat     consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment     point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,     and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for     measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special     white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which     permeated the planet\'s atmosphere.           The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just     north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag      would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened      hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.       This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as      well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.       The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar      to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists      had thought the planet\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight      due to the permanently thick cloud cover.          The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day     hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600     kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did     not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer     (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers     (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three     main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the     balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers     (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and     down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the     journey.  The layer\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius     (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.     The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.           Early in the first balloon\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already     headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with     a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13      and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the     composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the     Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen     minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to      accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6      miles) above the surface.           There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before     touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not     only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of     Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never      before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature      and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees      Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\'s      56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background      infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.          As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and      12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data     returned during the lander\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The     French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,      and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active      volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.     The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air     between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)     contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.          The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks      appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.     The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\'s results     nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers      instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were      three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50      and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a     thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),      much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-     cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air      over the last seven years.          When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last      functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on     for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around     the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March     6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the      dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.     The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial     bodies with one space vessel.          On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for     a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2     balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking     it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning     side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)     flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still     environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.     After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent      for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-     kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the continent of Aphrodite      Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5      miles) towards the surface.          Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air      layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius      (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1     balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed      through the balloon\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning     were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\'s nephelometer      failed to function.          The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite     Terra\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900     miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\'s resting place was smoother     than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a     relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in     working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,      rare on Earth but present in Luna\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in      aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree      of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured      463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,     essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.          Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at     a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin      to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030      kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet      is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers      (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three      hours.          Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley     encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the      probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-     Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance      of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets      had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly      a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was      not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.       VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.          Future Plans Diverted          The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous      ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second      world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for     the early 1990s.          This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple      probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft      would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon      probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\'s      corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over      the VEGA balloons\' two days.  The mission would then head out to      investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible      landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main      Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.          Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in     the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA     mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet     and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space      program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction      was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this      class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next      year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on     Mars\' largest moon, Phobos.           All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,     including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and      eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.     The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious     consideration of human colonization in the near future.          But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars     exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,     one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other     going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon     landing in March of 1989.           In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to     ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the     mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put      on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have     since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of     continuous robotic exploration of the planet.           During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change     was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began      to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with      the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the      culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking      a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market.          These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.     Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making     almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring     nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to      make money.            In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for      sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price      of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary      probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United      States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.          MAGELLAN and GALILEO           The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration     with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.     Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of     spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most      detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When     MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be     able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108     meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.          In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space      Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit      the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle      ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,      named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the      probe\'s primary target\'s major moons in 1610.          In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on     a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around     Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach     Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\'s first planetary     goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the     planet\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in     that violent atmosphere.          On the Drawing Boards          With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,     new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-     tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet      Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,      1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions      within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also     considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.          In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects      as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes     throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected     for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing     of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air     temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed     to study Venus\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air     with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.     Final project decisions will be made in 1994.          Humans on Venus                Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?     At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure     would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something     even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into     changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like     Earth\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking     will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide      atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability      to speed up the planet\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster     than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries     if not millennia.          In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand     Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how     a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became     instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?     Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found     through international cooperation, including the nation which      made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

1329,'Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\'an. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon God and His Messenger the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\'s case.  There is a distinction in the Qur\'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation,  the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many Muslims, and Rushdie\'s (and his publishers) Media games.     I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Qur\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Qur\'an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple this or that process. There may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\'an. The Qur\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:  ...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances  of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the Qur\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\'an.....  Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\'anic verses (Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them, so that they may beware. (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. I\'ve listed a few major  divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\'an, Sunnah, Consensus, Reasoning)  The study of Qur\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world. The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves? He (S.A.) replied: By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for your religion and shun them. I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as The fortress of Islam. My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Qur\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact.

86,' Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame. There\'s no inside and no outside, there are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the Bible, things are still not that clear, we don\'t have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the  few books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books, and there\'s a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.   This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical relativist. If you don\'t understand the underlying concepts, it is  pretty hard to continue with a dialogue.

Only through the careful analyses of engineering, chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.  So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs.

103,'I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.    First of all, I\'ve tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it\'s possible to give  succinct answers to most everything, but there\'s enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours, I\'m sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean  it) is great, but it\'s also important for me to have as broad a base of  individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it\'s a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.    Secondly, I hope some of the questions don\'t come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like What would convince you of the existence of God imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact, I\'m not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of God is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it\'s easier  than just repeating a deity or higher power every time.    Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system although I know some of you might contend that you don\'t have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.    ---------------  Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum  \tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?   Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.     In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe  in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume  that the answer to this is yes; if you\'ve always been an atheist, or at least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)   How serious was your/your family\'s involvement?    How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?    How and when did your final break with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I  realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se; whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.     What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your conversion to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?     To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the  plausibility of God\'s existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new secular religion, and that scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood.  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?)    ---------------  This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.    ---------------  Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I\'m doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what I\'ve asked about above.  ',0

INTRODUCTION       From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war; Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.       Science flourished during the European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries.       But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\'s gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planets.       The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the Sun\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.       These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft, color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light. And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.       Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century.        AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\'s (NASA\'s) automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.       Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well as for processing data and communicating with Earth.       Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power.       Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft.       The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\'s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a spacecraft\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.       Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid-rock composition.       For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.       All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies.       Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147 pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.       In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft. Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.       Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations. Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\'s light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.       NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters -- descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers from Earth and then studied martian features from above.       Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planet\'s dense cloud cover to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments -- radioed information about the planet\'s atmosphere during their descent toward the surface.       A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet.        The Sun       A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system; all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the material left over from the Sun\'s formation. One hundred and nine Earths would be required to fit across the Sun\'s disk, and its interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.       As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of fusion. The temperature at the Sun\'s core is 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there is 340 billion times Earth\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\'s surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature. At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.       The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a red giant, it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf -- the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.       Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\'s environment, but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft, launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\'s gravity to change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\'s polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.       We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly never have developed on Earth.        Mercury       Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus, the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the solar system\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.       Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is visible on Earth\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar telescopes gave any hint of Mercury\'s surface conditions prior to the voyage of Mariner 10.       The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet. These apparently were created when Mercury\'s interior cooled and shrank, buckling the planet\'s crust. The cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310 miles).       Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the density of Earth\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon and helium. When the planet\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun, surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit) on Mercury\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) -- is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time.       Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the Sun!        Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would make Mercury\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\'s core or those of any of the planets.       After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 -- before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the planet\'s surface.        Venus       Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2 spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus, plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\' surface, romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest.       On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839 kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544 miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\'s instruments measured the planet\'s magnetic field, ionosphere, radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner 10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.       In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4 of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.       Five days later, the five separate components making up the second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The four small, independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour.       Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet. However, spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For example, Venus\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward) compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other planets.       Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\' atmosphere (95 times as dense as Earth\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of Earth\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\' atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space. As a result, the planet\'s average surface temperature is 482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt lead.       A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet\'s dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet. NASA\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images of the surface.       Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\'s flank is a 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.       Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the San Andreas Fault in California.       Venus\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude, high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour, the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\' slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\'s winds blow in both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six alternating bands. Venus\' atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather.        Earth       As viewed from space, our world\'s distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.       Our planet\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\'s atmosphere protects us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system.       From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen radiation belts, surrounding Earth.       Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our planet\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. We\'ve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.       Besides affecting Earth\'s weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\'s magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet\'s magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.       Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of Earth\'s complex weather systems.       From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey Earth\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\'s health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways.        The Moon       The Moon is Earth\'s single natural satellite. The first human footsteps on an alien world were made by American astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.       NASA\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds) and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.       From this material and other studies, scientists have constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy. Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\'s existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain. As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across.       This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge, overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance, called maria, meaning seas.       As far as we can tell, there has been no significant volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years. Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars, by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.       The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet\'s gravity, or it was the result of a collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars. The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.        Mars       Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar system\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life. Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.       Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\'s surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.       So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out. Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.       Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide.       On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329 pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features, including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.       In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there? Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.       Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976, while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos sent back from the Chryse Planitia (Plains of Gold) showed a bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible dunes.       The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\'s soil chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there.       The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.       The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2 site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.       The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out, forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys.       There is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.       Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.       The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas. Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.       Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except Earth. NASA\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.         Asteroids       The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded, best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona.       Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object, the object would be only about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the diameter of our Moon.        Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through Earth-based telescopes.       Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the meteoroid does not burn up completely, what\'s left strikes Earth\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.       Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks.       Since asteroids are material from the very early solar system, scientists are interested in their composition. Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances.       Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy. One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials.        Jupiter       Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter was the first port of call.       Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter, flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\'s banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979.       These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize Jupiter\'s atmosphere.       It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. Because of Jupiter\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.       The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\'s atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a million years old.       Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\'s upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\'s northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.       Largest of the solar system\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a miniature solar system.       A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into Jupiter\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to Jupiter\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.        Galilean Satellites       In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet-sized satellites.       One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io. Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\'s surface.       Io\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three Galilean moons.       Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the brightest Galilean satellite. The moon\'s surface displays a complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt -- apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space. Europa\'s core is made of rock that sank to its center.       Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock. Ganymede\'s surface has areas of different brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of the moon\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface.       Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.       Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be performed by the Galileo Orbiter.        Saturn       No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\'s atmosphere has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\'s somewhat placid-looking appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) per hour.       Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979, returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\'s ring system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in August 1981.       The rings are composed of countless low-density particles orbiting individually around Saturn\'s equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.       The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\'s gravity. A third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet.       Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings.       Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from Saturn\'s ring system rather than its atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\'s auroras near Saturn\'s poles.       The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\'s rings and the gaps in the rings. Saturn\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.        Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\'s in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and Venus. Titan\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge. Unfortunately, Voyager\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\'s dense clouds.       Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting Titan\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\'s atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.       The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into Titan\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through Titan\'s clouds and will spend years examining the Saturnian system.        Uranus       In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet\'s discovery over two centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.       Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing around the solar system. During Voyager 2\'s flyby, the south pole faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system.       Voyager 2 found that Uranus\' magnetic field does not follow the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead, the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\'s center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.       Uranus\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water vapor. The planet\'s blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).       Uranus\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene, ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the planet\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow.       Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\' cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep. Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.       Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known -- Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity, including faulting and ice flows.       The most remarkable of Uranus\' moons is Miranda. Its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that, after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface.       Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged 11. In contrast to Saturn\'s rings, which are composed of bright particles, Uranus\' rings are primarily made up of dark, boulder-sized chunks.        Neptune       Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system with an investigation of Neptune and the planet\'s moons. On August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers (3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton. During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\'s atmosphere was more active than Uranus\'.        Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the size of Earth, in Neptune\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\'s Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed the Scooter, as well as high-altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per hour.       Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\'s core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants. Neptune\'s distinctive blue appearance, like Uranus\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.       Neptune\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\'s spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is similar to Uranus\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores, where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal. Earth\'s magnetic field, on the other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.       Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\'s rings. Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings. A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies were not spotted.       Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in 1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\'s glare for observers on Earth.        Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet\'s modest current rings.       Triton\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at Saturn and Uranus. Triton\'s mantle is probably composed of water-ice, but the moon\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain: the so-called cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap.        Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers (1 to 5 miles). Triton\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as thick as Earth\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited.        Pluto       Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside Neptune\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until March 1999. Pluto\'s orbit is also highly inclined -- tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.       Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball. The planet\'s diameter is calculated to be approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\'s surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\'s spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees.        The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in 1978. Charon\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\'s: the moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\'s and Charon\'s rotational period and Charon\'s period of revolution are all 6.4 Earth days.        Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.        Comets       The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star.       Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets.       As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma or cloud-like head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet\'s tails. Gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly. As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc.       Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun. The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in length, but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets -- from the Latin cometa, meaning long-haired -- are essentially dramatic light shows.       Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system.       Halley\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\' orbit. Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley, because he plotted the comet\'s orbit and predicted its return, based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to see it.       A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent appearance, Halley\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime. Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.       The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed; the first was NASA\'s International Cometary Explorer in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by Halley\'s Comet in 1986.        Conclusion       Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959, spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space.        We have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects.       The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets, moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.       We are also gaining insight into Earth\'s complex weather systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the Sun\'s activity and its influence throughout the solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on Earth.       We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid belt.       We can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony!',2

1206,'  We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\'t seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values, the ridges are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!

You might have a specific program that needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg 24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.  The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files. And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90\% quality (you can\'t see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 8bit gif!  Later\'ish Craig',1

I _do_ know that BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map\'s accuracy.

A mission to the main belt might be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C, each visiting a seperate asteroid and then returning to the main S/C.

Despite its small size and quickness,   it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:   standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,   mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or   different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each   graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually   infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are   almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four   different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and   other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.   Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),   including a portable metafile format and renderer.      Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on   hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot      At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:      Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix   Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT      Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   program with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects\' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm   development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily   extensible through script (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100\%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don\'t know...

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by painting it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator paint with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram.

Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose.    Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn\'t have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing programs for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software.    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: Laplacian, medium noise filter, etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can\'t be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Its for IBM PC\'s or   clones, cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not   as fast or as powerful, though I have had only limited experience with   Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good   starter program except for the obtuse manual  IMAGINE-32 ----------   It\'s a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called Imagine32   or Image32 The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,   subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.   It can also display a number of images simultaneously.   The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA.   PC Vista --------   It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.

It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It\'s image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD\'s vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.   Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System. It was developed by   CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Organization) and is   marketed/ supported by:    MPA Australia (51 Lusher Road, Croydon, Victoria   tel + 61 3 724 4488     fax  +61 3 724 4455)    There are educational and commercial prices, but be prepared to set   aside $A10k for the first educational licence.  Subsequent ones come   cheaper (they need to!) It has installed sites worldwide.  It is widely   used at ANU.  MicroImage ----------   The remote sensing lab here at Dartmouth currently uses Terra-Mar\'s   MicroImage, on 486 PCs with some fancy display hardware.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.   Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical   image community. They issue a newsletter also.   They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last   I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.    It\'s suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.   Very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of   documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.  ALV ---   A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to   comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to   alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.  AIPS ----   Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - AIPS++ - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) It\'s written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.   The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.   It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis),    medicine, biology, physics.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\'s environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn\'t that   difficult to write your own with their programmer\'s module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\'s Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters\'\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98\% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

140,' Yes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by I think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how much he missed.  I have studied Plato\'s Theory of Forms and  Aristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology, the id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus explained it far better and gave reasons.  Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They can screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these men on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.\'s autobiography correctly, he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.  Here\'s some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is  spiritually discerned.  And so, people without the spirit of God haven\'t a clue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that\'s incredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre.   I can see it, but you can\'t.  This is not arrogance on my part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless, it is a truth, explainable or not.  Are any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist\'s?  They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand out from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green, you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot test appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.  A normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a total anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something. It is hard for him to understand why I can\'t see anything that to him is as plain as day.  That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer. The believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns fit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the other hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn\'t see it.  He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and say, No, you are weird.  You do not see.   Then it is time for a sanity check.  I go to another Christian and say, Do you see this.  And they go, Yes.  It is an X.  And I say, Thank God, I see the X too.  It is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase,            He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear. ',3

Making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the    scripture     Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison, is now changed from    a Pre-Easter postion to post-easter by God postion is not supportable.      Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...       Yes, and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading   of the scriptures. You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural    proof need to be cross-checked. The referencs that you supply often do   not support your postion, if they are read in the context of the scripture.    \tHow about that those who have been in paradise, and have accepted \tthe gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ, and then return to the \tpresence of God. Is that somehow different from your expressed view \tthat the paradise spoken of (or Abraham\'s Bosom) \tShould we go back and discuss your view on why the Angle of the Lord \tis the Lord again... ;-)   ',3

172,'-*----  Far from being tossed out, the gospels are taken, almost universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus. I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who tosses out the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this, but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly.  Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels *not* taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken this way by a critical reader.  There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text, measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the text as historically valid or tosses out the text.  I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority, and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice.  Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as telling the gospel truth about historical events, in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite author\'s history of whatever.)  Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does the text provide evidence?  The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the  vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The modern American history textbooks that whitewash great American figures are historical evidence.  These are all historical evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that great American figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in school. They are better evidence that some people saw the Maharishi, late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe saw vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history.  How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer. There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\'s Historian\'s Fallacies as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history.  It\'s relatively cheap.  It\'s easy to read.

181,'MC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of MC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis MC> 1.  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  And which order of Creation do you accept?\tThe story of creation is one of the many places in the Bible where the Story contradicts itself.  The following is an example...  GEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle  after  their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. GEN 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image,  after  our likeness:  and  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and  over  all the  earth,  and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  GEN 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is  not  good  that  the  man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. GEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the  field,  and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature, that was the name thereof.  Even your Bible cannot agree on how things were created.  Why should we believe in it?',0
182,'   Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I can\'t believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.   I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one\'s belief critically.  I\'ll tell you something I left out of my \'testimony\' I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works, thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.   I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.  As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student\'s workload considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first attempt. However, I think I\'ll never forget the lesson:   No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X, it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent.  But it can still be wrong.   I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear,  filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god playing any part.    Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance, the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.  Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.   This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind, and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the evidence.   It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.   A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible again.   I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I\'m lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I can\'t go on lying to myself.  Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me, she\'ll know what to do. I\'m willing. I just don\'t know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence, it looks like she doesn\'t.   Petri',0

The slow shifting of the Earth\'s magnetic field isn\'t really significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth\'s magnetic field is to begin with.   Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth\'s magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course, this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the earth\'s magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction. And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).

199,' There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large part of the problem.  In this context, it\'s not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini.   It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.   Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things that can\'t be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is *not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.',2

211,' Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!  For example:  \tSIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same \tthing, a 127\% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the \tannual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, \twhich means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the \tproceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.  \tTOPLAS went up 40\% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.  \tBasic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI \tmembership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings, \tthese are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic \trate, equivalent services have gone up 100\% in cost.  \tSIGOIS membership cost has up 33\%, but they\'ve also split out the \tComputer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to \tbe included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG \talso has doubled its membership fee.  What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don\'t look so big.  But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90\% more than last year for a 31\% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31\% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

212,'(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)    Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer\'s question about the  temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said Dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they\'re at 40-150 K.  Well, I was dead wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren\'t_ good radiators in the far IR, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to take another ISM class :-(    In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is  that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].    He notes that the two recently discovered Kuiper Belt objects, 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same  mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth\'s moon.  There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\'t), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory.    He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\'s  orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane  frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see.    I hope I haven\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.

215,'I am pleased to announce that a *revised version* of _The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon_ (former title: _Mormon\'s Book_) by Lynn Matthews Anderson is now available through anonymous ftp (see information below). In addition to the change in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages (eliminating many extraneous that\'s and of\'s), and many (minor) errors have been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story, testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a Words-to-Know glossary.  As with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a not-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself for the precise terms.  Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I\'m out of the wire-bound first editions.) I will make another announcement about the availability of printed copies once everything has been worked out.  FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then cd pub (you won\'t see anything at all until you do).  The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon is currently available in postscript and RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the Macintosh and Windows. If you don\'t have a postscript printer, you may be able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.  -r--r--r--  1 dba                   1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps -r--r--r--  1 dba                   1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf  For more information about how this project came about, please refer to my article in the current issue of _Sunstone_, entitled Delighting in Plainness: Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon.

218,'   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few years ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens), the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.     I think you\'d have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the culture.  This may not always be wrong, but that\'s the way to bet. ',2

224,'Ken:  Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big Boys if you\'re tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.   Ahem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend so.   It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it\'s the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.    There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren\'t gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World\'s available space cash.  As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:  DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental X-plane hardware. It\'s been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they\'ve built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y.  I\'m sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics.  I don\'t see a realistic  prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If the DC flops, it\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear.  (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction.  It doesn\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks.  It\'s creating its own market for small payloads.)  I read the magazines and I\'ve attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today\'s world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line.  [...deleting some things I\'m not going to prove tonight...]  Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please.  The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the bird in the hand argument your common sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it.  Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.   If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a big difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?',2
225,' \tAs I don\'t know this book, I will use your heresay.   \tIt depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them.  \tSome religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.   \tReconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge, or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction.',0

You\'d need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.  What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector, and even scattering of photons off the Earth\'s atmosphere back onto the spacecraft.  I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2 degrees.',2

229,' Only if he doesn\'t spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches.  What\'s more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and the prize is just the icing on the cake.  I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current US launchers.  (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.)

1138,' \tThe first and only thing I\'ve ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines (not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no, dummy, you\'re going the wrong way.  \tSteve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool.  \tIn some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight, clean, and well imaged; you don\'t always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case.  \t(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.

If a scientist creates a unique living creature #(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the #right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?  Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions, but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you, me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9) in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression, an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of God\'s spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer\'s plan, most followed the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer\'s aspirations (I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . . Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven (And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . . Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).  To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices), we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Job 38:4-7).  We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the Veil of Forgetful- ness, somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.  You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.  #Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.  (All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd as they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They will cry heresy and other accusations of perverting the doctrines of the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)  As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not least, modern-day revelation on the subject.  #I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it. # #                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that #                        he is acting according to God\'s will, and who there- #     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by #                        stabbing you in the back? # #                                                        -Voltaire ',3

1077,' Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person\'s self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mental/verbal level, and don\'t usually find expression in society except in an impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.   Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue...    Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it doesn\'t hurt others?  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it is not a morality in that it doesn\'t propound any specifically preferred behaviours.   I\'ll add a hearty me two.  However, one could just as well say just because certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn\'t really get an impression of which one is truly right.     best regards,',0

260,'OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime, the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\'d do some more tests.  First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default 2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...',1
261,' [...stuff deleted...]  As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the  _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render  that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say that you don\'t believe something than it is to say that you don\'t have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  think about.  It\'s not either or.  Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind.    I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put  his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion. ',0

264,' Good point.  If you haven\'t read The True Believer by Eric Hoffer, do so at your first opportunity.  I don\'t know why Hoffer is out of style now, but The True Believer is still the best explanation of nutball behavior ever written.',3
265,' Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The large grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90\% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed.  Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation.  Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average temperature.  A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane.  To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from Allen\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and I believe that to be correct.)                           Dilution   Temp.

266,' Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in what?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn does not exist?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa Claus does not exist?  If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it certainly isn\'t as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god) DO exist.  (I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of faith.)  Besides... not believing in a god means one doesn\'t have to deal with all of the extra baggage that comes with it!  This leaves a person feeling wonderfully free, especially after beaten over the head with it for years! I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer for many people and for that reason I think it\'s important.  However, trying to force a psychological fantasy (I don\'t mean that in a bad way, but that\'s what it really is) on someone else who isn\'t interested is extremely rude.  What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better person, allowing me to live without guilt, etc...) and then tried to get you to believe in Santa too just \'cuz he did so much for me?

273,' My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but  got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering  the confusing spitting contest over \'rights\', (there are TOO  inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive  of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out  of my site.    (I ain\'t saying that dark skies are included in these  rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.)     Anyway, here are my thoughts on this:    I\'d like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly  practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for  research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, getting away from it all (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters  much either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t  fouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved.   Regards,  Wm. Hathaway  Baltimore MD  ',2
274,'marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Kevin Marshall) <1r2eba$hsq@csugrad.cs.vt.edu>  Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That is what I mean by the word ``faith\'\': belief without justification, or belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational) justification.  For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don\'t know why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that\'s faith.  Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information, or increased mental faculty.  Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion, because there is no faith nor dogma.  Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.  A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore, to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways\'\' is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed. Sure, interpretations of what ``God said\'\' are changed to satisfy the needs of society, but when God says something, that\'s it.  It was said, and that\'s that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the interpretations are flawed.  Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma. A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND, *AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available.  That\'s the only rational thing to do.  That\'s good philosophy.  Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed, and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion views its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them.  It\'s easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn\'t require a good rational justification of the killing.  I don\'t consider ``he\'s Jewish\'\', or ``he was born of Jewish parents\'\', or ``this document says he\'s Jewish\'\' to be good rational justification.   Clinton and the FBI would love for you to convince them of this. It would save the US taxpayer a lot of money if you could.',0
275,'----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------  -- WHAT IS LightWave? --  LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a device called the Toaster (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.  -- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --  This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group.  -- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --  Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software, I\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.  You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!  -- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --  To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain  Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon.  There shouldn\'t be too much of a delay in joining.  Expect a welcome message within 5 days after you send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!  -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --  Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the following address:          lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com  Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This doesn\'t mean it hasn\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address.  NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.  -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --  Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain  I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you.   -- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --  I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates.  If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>  I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please send a mail message to:          fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com  The first command to the server must be HELP or USER name <passwd>.  Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile. Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service. Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.    -- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --  Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>  If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact me at the address:          lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com  Cheers, ',1

277,'Brian Kendig first states:   I ask:   Brian Kendig states:   Make up your mind.    And we do not end perfect either.  We are never perfect.  Can you name one person, young or old, past or present, that you deem perfect?  Good luck.   Then you lie to yourself.  You do not know your shortcomings.  I have clearly shown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its  contents.   Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself. And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not even know what the word Christ means.  Or which prophet used Christ to  describe the Son of Man.    Yes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come up with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said and by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else\'s interpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the truth, 99\% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as  much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.  And remember, the Bible isn\'t a Guru\'s Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.   It doesn\'t take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The  Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed  to people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it  their open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to know.   They didn\'t encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple straight-forward language.   You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that road doesn\'t look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One that goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this, you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly.    I see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your life.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing  new in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are spouting off  contradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must be sad.   Bingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look what God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have  hope in his resurrection and know that life isn\'t for nothing, but has glorious purpose.   Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to lie to yourself that he doesn\'t exist, for you ignore what has been said for  thousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of  Jesus\'s story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a  bleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:        For if Lazarus doesn\'t even listen to Moses and the Prophets,        he won\'t even believe if a man rose from the dead.   Arrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific cases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does not expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.   You maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for yourself.    I do understand what you said.   But that\'s is not what I feel went amiss here.  You missed the point.  Living a good life has no eternal consequences. Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it  is over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless.  It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth.   But then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things  is bad.  To you, it shouldn\'t matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is all meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What\'s restraining you? Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.   At which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.   So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don\'t you see?  I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I can\'t similarly apply to Santa Claus.  You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses of Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the reasons.  By definition, ignorance.   Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose  blinks red?      On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really a king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon really kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin? Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did Sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a  Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies it.  It is NONFICTION.  Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you can\'t evaluate the context of Grimm\'s Fairy Tales apart from that of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out that it\'s not a fairy tale?   Get real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there to be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your  irrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life. ',3

279,' I see what you are getting at (or at least I think I do).  Correct me if I am mistaken, but I *think* you are asking me if I still believe that we should uphold all of the Laws pertaining to capital punishment for such things as adultery, rape and other heinous crimes.  As you may recall, Jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress who was caught in the act and brought before Jesus.  And His reply, Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  Jesus does not deny the sentence that is to due for this violation of the Law.  What do you think of this?   Agreed.  :)    Agreed also.  If one is to use the Bible as a reference, one must always be open to different interpretations.  As a Christian, I have the Spirit of God to verify what I believe in the Word.  If what the Spirit tells me is not backed up in scripture then the spirit I am communicating with is not of God.  After all, Jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that it is from God.   I obey what the Spirit of God tells me to do.  The Spirit will not violate anything that is written in the Bible because that is the Word of God.  I do not worship pastors, preachers, my wife, my mother or my father.  What they tell me does not carry the weight of what God tells me to do and His commands are rienforced in the Bible.    Eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting God.  If you choose to jump off a cliff, you can hardly blame God for you  going *splat* at the bottom.  He knows that if you choose to jump, that  you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice.  In fact, He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below.  To prove that point, Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being God was able to rise up again.  I have seen the example of Christ and have  chosen not to jump and I\'m trying to tell you not to jump or else you\'ll  go *splat*.   You don\'t have to listen to me and I won\'t stop you if you decide to jump. I only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge.  You owe it to yourself.

287,'With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity, I thought the following quotes by Mr. James Holly, the Anti-Masonic Flag Carrier, would amuse you all...       The following passages are exact quotes from The Southern  Baptist Convention and Freemasonry by James L. Holly, M.D., President of Mission and Ministry To Men, Inc., 550 N 10th St., Beaumont, TX  77706.         The inside cover of the book states: Mission & Ministry to Men,  Inc. hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of  this booklet with two provisions: one, the material is not changed and two, the source is identified. I have followed these provisions.          Freemasonry is one of the allies of the Devil Page iv.         The issue here is not moderate or conservative, the issue is God and the Devil Page vi.         It is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public  school education in America were Freemasons Page 29.         Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His  disciples, and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message. Page 30.         The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity  through fraternity, liberty and equality is toleration. This is seen  in the writings of the \'great\' writers of Freemasonry. Page 31.         He [Jesus Christ] established the most sectarian of all possible  faiths. Page 37.         For narrowness and sectarianism, there is no equal to the Lord  Jesus Christ. Page 40.         What seems so right in the interest of toleration and its  cousins-liberty, equality and fraternity-is actually one of the  subtlest lies of the \'father of lies.\' Page 40.         The Southern Baptist Convention has many churches which were  founded in the Lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the  Lodge. Each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of  repentance and of praying the blood and the Name of the Lord Jesus  Christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the  dedication of the church and/or building.

289,'[Stuff deleted]  Would Mr. Hart please explain how one could get every nation on earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the night sky without `coercion\'.   Remember that not every nation follows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of history, it was probably true that the rulers `owned\' everything not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America, where by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn\'t noticed, there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what. Of course, if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it would hardly be non-coercive.  Some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space and also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example) to discourage them.   This of course would be too coercive for Mr. Hart.',2

Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son & lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me.

Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater), could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black, prob. IS connected to that Ka\'aba they\'ve got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women. They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.

Too bad for Kuwait.  No, unfortunately, sitting back and letting things be is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein\'s military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.

This does not, however, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another in a specific set of circumstances.

Which that statement are you talking about?   I still don\'t quite see what you\'re trying to say.  I assume by values you mean moral values, yes?  In which case, what do you mean by real?

If you\'ve ever downloaded images from BBS or the net, you\'ve probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some look too light. Why is this ? you may ask. This, is gamma correction (or the lack of it).  Why do we need gamma correction at all ? --------------------------------------  Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene, then you have created a linear or un-gamma-corrected image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\'t_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this:  Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma  So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get what you want. So you have to do this to your image:  gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)  For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.  If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ? -----------------------------------------------------  The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are  rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those images with a program that doesn\'t do gamma correction, then it will look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT.  Whose fault is all this ? -----------------------  It is really three things. One is all those display programs out there that don\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is that most image formats don\'t specify a standard gamma, or don\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying gamma\'s.  At least two file formats do the right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).  Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has, and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.  [ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\'t provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls doesn\'t do the right thing, as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image. ]  How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ? ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.)  If your viewer doesn\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness will be above the center.  If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be around 2.2   [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag, and once you\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile]  How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? -------------------------------------------------  This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other.  If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.  If your viewer doesn\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.  Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing -----------------------------------------------------  One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. This means images  could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance), if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level.  If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma, and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.  (I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).',1

319,' RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.    After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST\'s orbit.  I think right now  it\'s sitting  at 180 miles up, they would like  220.  I don\'t know the exact orbit numbers. I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit.   Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended duration orbiter pallet.  It\'s mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.  THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS) and Orbiter Duration.     In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy thing.  THe HST isn\'t light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it\'s own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle, for a given orbital change.    From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can\'t even carry extra Suits or MMU\'s.  Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess, that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,  and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.  or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit. The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing, and longer drag life.   a Whatever it is,  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint on HST ops.',2

Iraq still is not allowed to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but is still surviving.   Of the ~93\% (I have heard figures closer to 80\%, but I won\'t quibble your figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions.    2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.

That figure came not from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such stuff in another part of DoD.  3.

This figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.

I hear that it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.  The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats -- again, any one of them would have been adequate.

What\'s worse, a lot of the formats aren\'t even implemented very well, e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses bytes rather than pixels.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used    for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for double size scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\'m not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.  Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...  -Peter Lee   ',1

When you say (paraphrased) #in (2) that this is not evidence for [benefactor], for example, what you #mean is that it\'s no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].  Yes, that\'s what I mean.  #In (3), however, you\'ve shifted the meaning of evidence for [benefactor] #so that it now means `absolute\' evidence for [benefactor] rather than #`relative\' evidence for [benefactor] w.r.t. [bug].  Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say, in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions (prayer, your \'Rapture\' example), I don\'t buy your use of Occam\'s razor in all cases where A=0.  In my example, one couldn\'t dismiss [benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh.  I brought up the \'one-by-one dismissal\' process to show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\'re saying in this post, it seems you agree, and we\'re talking at cross-purposes.  #(3) is still in contradiction to (1). # #Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account: # #  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1 # #Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug #which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then # #   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d) # #so # #   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1 # #but (3) implies that # #   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.  No, this isn\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with necessarily no new observation (we\'ve already seen the dosh) to change those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\'s precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.    Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds that the answer can\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).  #> As they do when the set M is filled by the universe is caused by x, #> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation #> tends to one conclusion over the other. # #Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don\'t throw out any of #these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.  Some people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science. My sole point was that they aren\'t.  #>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x #>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite #>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the #>> hypotheses out. # #> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear. # #You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.  I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.  #> What I\'m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of #> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for #> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isn\'t true that those for #> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor. # #On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which #can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this #thread.  Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which means that you\'re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we\'ve already established that it\'s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over all i.  #> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or #> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and #> at worst barking mad. # #Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions. You wouldn\'t be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank? #Although that doesn\'t, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case #(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al). # #But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is #evidence against an hypothesis, that doesn\'t imply that observation of #the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the #estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\'s still #evidence against H.  No, I got that.  I\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\'re clearly correct when A!=0.   And I\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\'s certainly possible that I\'ve misunderstood what you\'re saying).  However, by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely, and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don\'t exist, or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this (including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain a fallacy upon close examination.  If that\'s not what you\'re saying, then please put me straight.',0

(And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the yaar at the end of a sentence, Butbutbut, the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)  At the time I still sorta-kinda thought of myself as a muslim, and I couldn\'t see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed\'s wives, and had not (as my grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed\'s wives were prostitutes; in short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely.  (And I won\'t mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)  Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent? She can come directly to me, can\'t she? How do we know that Muhammed didn\'t just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn\'t screw up, or put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some holy guy. Not to mention murder the author.)   I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read Mein Kampf? It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don\'t they just read the book and decide for themselves?  Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of protest from the liberal muslims to Khomeini\'s fatwa outrage, was the final push I needed into atheism!  -s',0

380,' [ Deletia; in case anybody hadn\'t noticed, Frank and I are debating   objective morality, and seemingly hitting semantics. ]         It may be that, being a non-native English-speaker, I\'ve misunderstood your usage of objective, and tried to debate something you don\'t assert; my apologies. I\'m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean, though.         Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity\'s sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can have.        I\'m saying the Universe has a real age, because I see evidence for it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of people\'s opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results.         I can\'t see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be the same.         Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests (which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we conducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don\'t, which I take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.         Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean physical pain. You have a sharp point, I\'ll give you that; but you still haven\'t given me a way to quantify morality.         We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable, producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.         Better and worse are (almost?) always defined in the context of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within* *that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of good and bad; I wish you luck.         Isn\'t that what _you\'re_ doing, when assuming an objectively real morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my statement?         Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was objective, at least one should be way off base, but yet hir \'incorrect\' morality seems to function fine. How come?        As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick them from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).  [ deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]         One thing is good under some circumstances, because we wish to achieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something else, and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all.        Some things are hard to make good, because we\'d seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still, the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.        I almost always know what good means; sometimes I even know why. I never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone, immutable.  [...]        Yes, me too, and I\'ve tried a thing or two down that line; it doesn\'t look good for objective values to me at all. ',0

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural, real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot, you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for, you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still, I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information, as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article How to find sources. (If you don\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body.  The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful --- it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for canned software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don\'t see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work, you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20, that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files, and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you\'ll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool, and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG, NewAmyJPEG, VJPEG, and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\'t forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article How to find sources, referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\'d like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer, color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already, so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing, and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read, it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why, it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

The man-made laws are NOT working.                  WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE!             Perpetrators remain IGNORANT of The LAW--a universal, cosmic,            and Spiritual Law--The LAW of RETRIBUTION or KARMA:                            Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a            man soweth, that shall he also reap.  Galatians 6:7, KJV.                      He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity;            he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.             Here is the patience and faith of the saints.  Revelation            13:10, KJV.                      What goes around comes around.                 This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical            law that for every action there is an equal and opposite            REaction.                      It is the ENFORCEMENT, the TEETH, behind The GOLDEN            RULE: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.                  ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in            the future, most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION.  Most            victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually            during a PREVIOUS LIFE.                            What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of            EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in            a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence),            that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this            life or the next.                            Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the            related LAW of Retribution, should read books such as HERE            AND HEREAFTER, by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several            kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including            HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50\% accurate; the            subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially            with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by            young children, some of whom can identify their most recent            previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL            of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off            land while traveling there for the first time on vacation),            the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN            SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including            Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of            Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before            he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!).                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person\'s PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT            life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.

394,'The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....  Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by NASA headquarters.  The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held.  The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:  ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called Bus-1 spacecraft, the orbiter and Spacelab.  The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.  Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.  ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data Management System.  Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.  Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the U.S. lab.  Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.  Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and propulsion systems.  The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.  Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said.  ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C, the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after ET separation.  The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 decks connected by a centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements.  This can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial attitude.  In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\'Connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.  Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.  Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the Soyuz TM spacecraft.  The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will be available to the SRT through May 5.  Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various management options have been developed including:  ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of command.  ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate Administrator.  ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office.  ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program.  ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.  The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.  As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations.  What\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday and Tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to be held May 3.  Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\'Connor will take over the activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.  Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being carried on the schedule are:  April 26 Design Freeze on Options for Costing  April 27 Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT  May 3 Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee  May 15 Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee  June 7 Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee ',2

398,'   I use it to refer to those Christians who take a more conservative-literalist approach to the Bible, as distinct from liberals.   I would use the word Christian (unqualified) to describe someone to whom the above definition applied.  BTW, it applies to me.  [deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh\'s beliefs and/or practices.]  I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT with children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided, I think they should have the legal right.  And I hope the investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any *legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).  [Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I\'ll (provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support the allegations?]  Actually I wasn\'t thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several women in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh\'s beliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a civil liberties perspective.    I think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not at Ray Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but at Stephen Tice.  ',3
399,'  This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced and therefore more intelegent that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have no clue as to weather they are intelegent or not.   That\'s a good point, I hadn\'t thought of it that way.  My question however was more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night. Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn\'t resolved these issues on our own?   But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and more.

401,' Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By  the time they could make the Earth\'s sky look like Las Vegas,  the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as 5000 kg in a Low Earth advertising orbit: Very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...  The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very  pristine...   There\'s always been a problem of having to get  away from civilization before you can really find natural scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn\'t take a trip of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still wild. While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital billboards aren\'t the problem: They are just a symptom of  growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky, because by the time  such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_ the stars...    An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need a telescope to see them. However, I\'d love to see them get all the publicity they could from underwritting the Coca Cola Io Orbital Mapping Probe.     They already can, to some extent: The IAU allows names derived from sponsors or patrons of scientific research. If Microscum donates money to a university astronomy program, one of the galactic  astronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after them.',2

1025,'Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...       Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time.  A good reference on this might be: Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639). by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\'s a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane    The design (the concept is also called Beta) as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support.  System design reliability is .9995.    Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage.    To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.    Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\'s success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.      The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn\'t carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable.       Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.    Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government\'s future space transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the 4-2-3 architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov\'t space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to leap frog new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.    It\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\'t that there aren\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor   ',2

429,'Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator\'s  \tContest Announcement)  WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?  ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer  peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that  uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to  a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR  gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality,  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: =====================================  ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware  protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing,  framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running, without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards, locators, and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and  Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples  of the interface from applications to the device drivers.   To Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):',1

433,' [ ... my stuff deleted ... ]   Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn\'t.  This board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters\' experiences regarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to share resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come here to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism.     If you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic.     The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names of some analagous Islamic groups?)    When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her Christianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread enough, it can change societies.  The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.',0
434,'Why should anyone (check: let\'s restrict this to Christians, why do *we*) want to find commandments in the books regarded as scripture?  What\'s going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted at me often enough by those who don\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said to have) said, If you love me, you will obey my commands.  [John 14:15]  I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I should do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother, but still under His direction, though we both call God Abba.  Christians, therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure. Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as slaves of Christ) -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts (whether classified as inspired or not) that are held up as models, in an effort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges from devotional reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as the Word of God.  And at the highest pitch, this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as absolute guidance for our actions.  The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the witness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments can we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard question.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike *most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]  Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] I give you a new  commandment: love one another.  This is the ONLY place in the NT where Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we *readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus says, Take this [bread]; this is my body.  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26, Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_), and hence this, too, is a commandment.  In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\'s mention (at least; this is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to bind Christians to the original command to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.  I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command. I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\'S notion, that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\' command directed at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference. The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of Christ.  All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out of the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts -- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without *some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows, that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ I don\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current purposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done.  Among the reasons we have for seeing John\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic Great Commandment is that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, You have learnt say to you: love your enemies.  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted does NOT say \'hate your enemy\' -- it is merely the common human presumption. (And Leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers amongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context, goes on to have Jesus say. Even sinners love those who love them. [6:27] All of this suggests [quite strongly, I\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the scope of the new commandment is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is in force on Christians, and with objects not limited to other Christians.  Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is the case of the Great Commission where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve are sent out to evangelize, Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand.  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in Do not turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town -- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\' final journey to Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians than the previous examples.  That hasn\'t prevented Christians from MAKING such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand even (contrary to Jesus\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to the ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as a commandment in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I accept this?  I don\'t know.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may) infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural (though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by OTHER references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)  Let\'s move on to the Great Commandment -- that we should love God with our whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic equivalent of John\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED as a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with the Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]  \tBut when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees \tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question, \tMaster, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?  It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\' answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a polemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as (so the scribe in this version says) far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this) or sacrifice.  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question to disconcert Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains [ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of Jesus\' use of the Torah in the (all quite different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.  The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted that ONLY in Luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of the Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where 7:12 gives the Golden Rule as the meaning of the Law and the Prophets (and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation before Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not *explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this intertextuality.  My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ has to apply beyond the  community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers, applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the presentation not saying so explicitly) a commandment to Christians. Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.  The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as  commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is  pretty clear, The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her.  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew has an escape clause [ except in the case of fornication, 5:31 ]. This seems to be a rather clear commandment (whether or not we take Matthew\'s reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\'t, at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition?  I\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this is enough to start with.  The theme is: finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions, that is, our own cultural biases.  I have, so far, identified a very few commandments that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that US law refuse to allow it, or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in their churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\'t* enter into  consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in even the most liberal church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge, so that the public ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively CREATED by a famous divorce! ]',3

447,'Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\'ve      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some Creator      was behind the universe\'s existence.  I\'ve      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I\'ve known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I\'ve even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher      being.  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      truth of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur\'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture\'s truth is to damn one\'s soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its truth      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn\'t stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the right readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with mystery.      Circular arguments, self-evdent facts and      truths, unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he\'s been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with mythical gods (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God\'s existence and question it impartially?

450,'    I would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did  definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it was Descartes who said that All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.  If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that\'s simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher.  Regarding Nietzsche, he\'s one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now.  They\'ll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.  As for modern philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and  amplified them over time).  I would say that the most influential american philosopher would have to be Dewey.  But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was American, but was born in Russia).

466,' Never claimed it is a bug.    Never claimed it is a bug.    I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups.  I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.  Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image, we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.    Never claimed it is a bug. I tried kept sure I don\'t claim that JPEG is noting else than a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is. (You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many places so far.)  You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it. ',1

469,'More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the E&S Freedom.   Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.  ------  Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market penetration.  There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developer\'s dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features, however, will remain much more flexible.  The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user\'s system. Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali\'s configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade them separately as needed.  Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI\'s more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications. Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable solution.  Hope this helps,  Brian',1

472,'     First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you\'re confused about this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest that the weakness is your reference material.  Get An Introduction to Ray Tracing by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.      On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\'s another issue =^).  So, you get some illumination equation like this:          I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent      The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this:          I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt      That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a purple-colored glass object.      Hopefully this answers your question.  I\'ll forward my illumination equation sermon to you also.',1

474,'I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would like to have in your applications.    A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the  application.  It may let you  - manipulate application data, the camera,   3-D objects in the scene and so on, or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects   via the widget\'s shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible.  For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis.   Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool. Your help is very much appreciated.',1

The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:  The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes Computer Graphics book is certainly a good start.  Chapter 6 is Viewing in 3D, then read chapter 15, Visible-Surface Determination.  For more information go to chapter 16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.   3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.  Find a copy of Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display by Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH \'82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).  A variant method is described in Graphics Gems, p. 287-293.  Note that the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site, as described above.  Check out John Bradley\'s Diversity Algorithm, which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual.  The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower.  There\'s also an implementation of:  Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988), pp. 153-162.  avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code, in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.   4) Converting color into grayscale.  The NTSC formula is:      luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue   5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.  The only reference you need for this stuff is:      Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6  But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion.   6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.  The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source. This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling.  However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation, by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface \'86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears in Graphics Gems (see section [1]) under the original title.   7) Free image manipulation software.  There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions. Here are pointers to some of them:      xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format     conversion package.

There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for details on some.  Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this.  You may find useful information there.   8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.  You almost certainly don\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.  These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.  A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently, neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.  FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It\'s a file format most often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.    9) Converting between vector formats.  A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.  There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac. A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.  On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive site.  A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\'s X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you\'re clever.  But in general, the answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial.  GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2).   10) How to get Pixar films.  The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:      Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price     Luxo, Jr.\t\t\t\t$14.95\t\t\t$50.00     Red\'s Dream\t\t\t\t$19.95\t\t\t$75.00     Tin Toy\t\t\t\t$24.95\t\t\t$75.00     Knickknack\t\t\t\t$24.95\t\t\t$75.00     Luxo, Jr./Red\'s Dream/Tin Toy\t$39.95\t\t\t$100.00  All tapes are on 1/2 VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also available:      Tin Toy T-shirt\t\t\t$15.00     Knickknack 3D T-shirt\t\t$15.00 (includes glasses)  For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add $3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international, 213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify prices and availability.  Or, just write to:      Direct Cinema Limited     1749 14th Street     Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342  Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:  At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it\'s available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar\'s address).      Pixar     1001 West Cutting Blvd.     Richmond, CA. 94804     (510) 236-4000      (510) 236-0388 (FAX)  You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains Luxo, Jr., Red\'s Dream, Tin Toy and Knicknack for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I  ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don\'t expect  to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.   11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?  The short answer is, You can\'t.  Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to do the job right, consult the article:    A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles   by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller   in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,   September, 1989, pages 48-56.  For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:    Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture   by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,   Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.  For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:    Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves   by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken   in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),   June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]   12) How to order standards documents.  The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900, mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the complete name and number.  Some useful numbers to know:  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\'s Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.  Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179.   13) How to FTP by email.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm, and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying help and it will tell you how to use it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.   14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.  Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\' article in Glassner\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including treatment of special cases.  Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.  Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.   15) How to tessellate a sphere.  One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. It\'s available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.  16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.  Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:  Highlights of this edition-      i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through        November \'91;     ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG         International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, \'91;     iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;     iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;     v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.  The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long. Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It\'s named speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z and is compressed at most sites-               Site                             Dir \twuarchive.wustl.edu\tgraphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ \tkarazm.math.uh.edu\tpub/Graphics/ \tgondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au\tpub/papers/ \tnic.funet.fi\t\tpub/sci/papers/graphics \tcoral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/  Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies.  These are in refer format, and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as RayBib.* and RadBib.*.  Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This collection is available at most of the sites above as rtabs.*.  17) SIGGRAPH information online  [from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]  ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org (128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.  The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories.  To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to      archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with the command      send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.   18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available  [from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]  ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH \'91 Panels Proceedings at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available in three formats:      text   (ASCII)      rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)      word   (MS Word for the Macintosh) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:  (1) by anonymous ftp     change to one of the directories        publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]     The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word     files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary      mode.      Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the     contents of each panel file.  (2) by electronic mail     send mail to        archive-server@siggraph.org     You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you     first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages        send panel91-txt index        send panel91-rtf index     in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary     information to retrieve the actual transcript files.   19) Graphics mailing lists  There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing.  Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats, no software       (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).       Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.   21) What about GIF?  GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don\'t like it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.  Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc, \talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, \talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers  Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:  /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of:  send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Send a message containing help to get general information about the mail server.  Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and 20 above for more information.   22) What is morphing?  Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:          morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)         morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)         m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)  The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards.   23) How to ray-trace height fields  Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.  The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:  F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July, 1988 <musg88.ps.Z>  This is available as Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639 from Yale University, it\'s also in the SIGGRAPH \'91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it\'s available on the net:      nic.funet.fi\t\tpub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z     weedeater.math.yale.edu\tpub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     princeton.edu\t\tpub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     coral.cs.jcu.edu.au\t\tgraphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z     gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU\tpub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z  An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

Pn, not in the x-y plane, is given by       Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |  where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal to P0.   25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH  Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM. Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00, Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)  SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions on Graphics) it\'s another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or Associate Members.  If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it\'ll cost you $59.00 (no student discount).  There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.  ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet.  Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

483,' Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there would appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\'s right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\'s interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up, some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these  groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard  was annoying.)  Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at organized Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular Islam - an Islam separated from it\'s Qur\'an, it\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslim\'s made their anger at his book known. The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this time, already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals. The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications. At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.  Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as  this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind, has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular heroic Knight,mounted on the his media steed,  doing battle with the dragon of Islamic fundamentalism.  Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who  grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\'s hold dear,  who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who, when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation, continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist. Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdie\'s continued media mischief even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support, government support was just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making, was applied to Rushdie.   I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. Image is the chief concern of Muslim \'apologists\' for Islam and for Rushdie. If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good image (Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image). A good image usually means  be more like me.  Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis. ',0

490,' Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that, in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being Hebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority  of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has Kethuvim or Writing status.]  Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:  DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name. Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\'s restoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per- forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name Daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).   The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\'s transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of several Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith.   The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a son of man invested with rule (this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.   The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent.   The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation. Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.',3

At the time,I felt  that the idea of a big mother ship had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\'s?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society\'s Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard\'s Star - i.e. a large bus spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The bus could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the real Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two sub-probes could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small swarm of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a  small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy,  well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course.   MARCU$',2
512,' Well, as I remember Jacoby\'s Mythmaker talks about this to cite one source -- but I\'m not sure if all Christians have read this book. In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated as a Lutheran, having a lot of Christian friends, and I even have played in two Christian rock bands!  So, over to you, do you have any counter claims, sources et  rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept of a social promise that is independent on the social status?  Cheers, Kent',0

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental aspects of their advertising.  Fred\'s argument is roughly akin to saying that it\'s bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn\'t advertise in newspapers.  Think that through, Fred.  Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure, filled with bio-degradable foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a year.  Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science experiments proposed and built by high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs.  Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages to every country.  During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface, and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all to see.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368',2

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can\'t be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There\'s a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: An Introduction to Ray Tracing, in   Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD, ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  Displays on Display column of IEEE CG&A Jan \'87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell\'s teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep \'87 in Jim Blinn\'s column Jim Blinn\'s Corner describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you\'re advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here\'s a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles\' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model\'s distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\'t normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\'m not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. \'ice\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\'s a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it\'s an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\'m not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\'ve   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\'s a   freebie if you want it    My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\'s mostly astronomical   image processing which I\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called GVLware.  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

Molecular visualization stuff =================================  [ Based on a list from cristy@dupont.com < Cristy > , which asked for  systems for displaying Molecular Dynamics, MD for short ]  Flex ----   It is a public domain package written by Michael Pique, at The Scripps   Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. Flex is stored as a compressed,   tar\'ed archive (about 3.4MB) at perutz.scripps.edu [137.131.152.27], in   pub/flex. It displays molecular models and MD trajectories.  MacMolecule -----------   (for Macintosh).

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it\'s public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software. A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   tar archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The PCI software consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI   database disk file.  The Tape I/O package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the PCI database file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5), and   God only knows what all else -- there\'s a LOT.  I don\'t have and don\'t   use these, so can\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters, read from   a common parameter file which must be (in VMS anyway) in your default   directory.  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\'s   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls raw) data from tape, in a number of different   interleave orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry\'s CT2T format, would probably (I haven\'t tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It\'s worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to   contain not only raster (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI database).    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be overkill   in your case; it seems designed for the very high end   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\'t suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\'s   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\'re interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

530,' No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts of their budget allocated upgrades, maintenance, and new purchases, and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually leases and so is the software.  Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a  Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting, payroll, etc.  Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts, you\'d sure as hell see every engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)',1

534,'FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE            The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24           in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-           laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-           GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-           tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was           represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS           users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-           dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and           academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS           users  to  take  charge of your PHIGS by participating in PHIGS           standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS           implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,           described his vision of the future of graphics standards  beyond           PHIGS.            Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following           topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,           Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented           Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS           Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and           Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed           a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The           conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-           ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools           based on PHIGS.            Next year\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.            PHIGS EVERYWHERE            At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated           PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to           mainframes.            Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including           conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing           and translucency.            Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-           Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add           advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like           ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.           Radiosity support is also planned.            FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging           graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate           mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase           and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.            TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful           2-call  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-           oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.            G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on           Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-           sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-           tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS           developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS           internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data           Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS           for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described           their application GSE that allows application callback  functions           during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\'s data visual-           izer and application development toolkit, are currently available           on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or           Starbase.            Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows           and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most           of the PHIGS+ primitives.

540,'My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle and died on Day 9 of the siege.  On Day 11 of the siege he rose from the dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the next 40 days.  Living with someone who\'s risen from the dead isn\'t easy, as Timmy Baterman\'s father in *Pet*Sematary* could attest, so after 40 days they did what Baterman did--shot themselves and burned the place to the ground.  Consistent with the facts, isn\'t it?  Did anyone actually *see* Koresh between Day 9 and Day 11?',3
541,' Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins on the HST re-boost mission.  A while back i had asked why not carry the EDO pallet up,  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough, they weren\'t even carrying extra suits.   Where\'s wingo when you need him:-)  COme on.   Knock that S**T off.  YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning for the repair EVA\'s.   Also during theøÄ    Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations. I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.  And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it bad enough.  YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they\'d ahve to do is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.  Don\'t get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate missions slip,   the Discovery won\'t launch on this mission until March.  that\'s almost a year.   Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.  YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.  The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA\'s  with 3 reserve walks.  If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that\'s $500 million saved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days. and  handle any contingency  problems,  that\'s quite a savings.    Of course,  there wasn\'t any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.  as for the problems with the aperture door,  I am sure they can work out some way to handle  that.  Maybe a Plug  made from Frozen ice.?   it\'ll keep out any contamination, yet sublime away  after teh boost.',2

544,' I disagree.  It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight but sees it as an elitist activity.  Not one which he is ever going to participate in.   Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document, you\'ll need a more general publication.   As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering the microworld isn\'t the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have to orbit a farm.  Well that\'s obviously not very efficient, so we use  technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of  using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don\'t have the answers to.  Like, in  dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in  hydroponics it turns out that you can\'t do that.  The lettuce growth is  stunted when it\'s grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So  now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that\'s what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together.  That\'s where we are now.   First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation. This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.   Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net, I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search  first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data base itself could be useful for future engineers.  That\'s my response Ken, what do you think?',2

Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.  Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:  Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, Mat26:54 that thus it must be?  Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.  If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture\' had not been accessible then it probably would be a different matter.',0

553,'    This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur\'an and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead, really can\'t respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism.   So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning  more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur\'an and understanding it\'s  basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see  who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at  odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve  muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles  of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than  any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical  nature.

Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering in the politcs of newly renunified Yemen, including assasinations and  border incursions.

559,' Isaac Asimov read creationist books.  He read the Bible.  He had ample opportunity to kneel before his Creator and Savior.  He refused.  In fact, he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the American Humanist Association, shortly before he died.     --excerpt from Ken Ham, Asimov Meets His Creator, _Back to Genesis_      No. 42, June 1992, p. c (included in _Acts & Facts_ vol. 21, no. 6,      June 1992, from the Institute for Creation Research).  This is one      of the most offensive articles they\'ve ever published--but at least      it argues *against* a deathbed conversion.  There\'s a part of the      article even worse than what I\'ve just quoted, in which an excerpt      from a reader\'s letter says that if Asimov is burning in hell now,      then he certainly has had a 180-degree change in his former beliefs      about creation and the Creator.

565,'Sorry about the delay in responding, due to conference paper deadline panic.   [Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]   That (complicated) isn\'t in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it\'s more the other way around. It\'s from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\')  where G\' is the complement of G  and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG\') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense, HG is necessarily more complicated than H for any H and G, so I may be splitting hairs, but what I\'m trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG) holds, with equality if and only if P(HG\') = 0.   Well, P(x | A) = P(x | B) means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):    P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>      P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)  where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).  So A and B are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesn\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.  In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\'t know the actual values, and it\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG.   That\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or not a `divine component\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\'.  Now it seems to me, as I\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather *less* well if one proposes a `divine component\' in addition, since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\'t even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission, G is `divine component\', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.   Not that I\'m a statistician as such either, but:  The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the (read `my\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways.  This means that these regions of the space of possible observations,  which I loosely termed appearances of god/s, have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.  Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism expends on making appearances of god/s possible must come from somewhere else (i.e. other possible observations).  All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\'t* an appearance of god/s must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.  Sorry if that\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\'s rather difficult to put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total area under them is always unity.  An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is the coin is fair, and that B is the coin is unfair (two-headed). (I\'ve used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)  Then    P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1   P(T | A) = 0.5  }    P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1   P(T | B) = 0    }  The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they don\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads.  Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are modified according to                              P(H | A)   e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                               P(H)  and                              P(H | B)   e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                               P(H)  Now we don\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed.  Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have                   n   e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)  and                     n   e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),  and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.  The loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism, and between fair coin and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which would falsify unfair coin, is analogous to an appearance of god/s, which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle is the same.    Quite so, but this type of theism is what I might call the G in the HG, in terms of our Ockham\'s Razor discussion, and I\'d bin it on those grounds.   The hypotheses don\'t have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model\', the theism isn\'t falsifiable.    You don\'t have to. We don\'t need, in the above analogy, to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity. You don\'t need to know the initial values of the running estimates either. It\'s clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin) approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.  All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible under Ha, and all else is equal.   Any observations you like; it really doesn\'t matter, nor affect the reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of god/s. Examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of revelation.    OK, we\'ll downgrade *does* interact to *may* interact, which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced.   I\'ll explain, but bear in mind that this isn\'t central; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction Appearances of god/s will never happen, as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn\'t make this prediction either, the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition.)  Predictions include such statements as Prayer is efficacious (implying If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious), or Prayer is *not* efficacious, or Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. I don\'t think we have any problems of misunderstanding here.    That\'s fine; I don\'t claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.     I think you are; an appearance of god/s is sufficient to falsify atheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.   No: by way of a counterexample, let X = the coin is fair, or more accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) the two sides of the coin are different. This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable, and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.     Oops. Sorry. Mea culpa.   We agree here.   The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992. Said Rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure to happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it.  No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its explanation will ever be observed. That about sums the whole thing up.   Cheers  Simon',0

574,'  Well, the best thing to do is to read the book Parallel Universes by Dr. Fred Wolf.   In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic particle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of these universes there is a particle in a different location. When we do something to make a particle appear, we are actually causing all the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is one line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some of the scientific community.  Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused by the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates that if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness is the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).  It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practiced in my religion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of communication between ones current, and possible future selves.  I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection of one of many possible futures.  I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep  an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile  explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, the more we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learn that it is truly a very strange place. ',3

This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.)

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can\'t find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    Alt.Atheism FAQ:.  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are help and    send atheism/index.  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed; it\'s not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.    it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. ',0

I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are      pertinent.       Luke 23:43 records Christ\'s promise to the repentant thief who hung on      an adjacent cross: Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in      paradise. But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead      and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until      Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The      answer lies in the location of paradise when Jesus died.       Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.       Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and       Lazarus as Abraham\'s Bosom, to which the godly beggar Lazarus was      carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus      Abraham\'s Bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed      waited till the day of Christ\'s Resurrection.       It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of       hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith      but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven      until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or      even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with      the Father.       Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the      repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But      on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene      (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then      took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise      (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in      Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: Ascending on high, He led captivity      captive; He gave gifts unto men. Verse 9 continues: But what does `He      ascended\' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the      earth? -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: He who descended is the same      as He who ascended above all the heavens. Presumably He led the whole      band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of      preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.  ra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is ra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra> look at the Bible in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see Biblical things differently from you?       I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my \'personal       interpretation\' is questioned, I usually give a reason.       As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where      there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it.        I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one       views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff       that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can       have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put       forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to       dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views      that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.  ra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra> understands it?       If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is       wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply       stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from       Scripture and then we can go on. ',3

596,'I\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I\'ve encountered in 2 different PEX implementations.  I can\'t find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\'s _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\' documentation).  I\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this, it\'s a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\'s worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  I\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1.  Open questions:     (1) Why does this happen?         --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?         --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which             could be corrected for?         --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their             interpolators?         --  Something else?     (2) What to do about it?         --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in Z-buffered HLHSR?         --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching             artifacts?         --  Am I just out of luck?  Any help would be immensely appreciated! ',1

What on Earth is the gravisphere? Anyway, before it\'s decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they  detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances. In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.  _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed.

598,'    (deletion)     Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. The point is that theism is *a* factor.       That\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.       That\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.   Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.     And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.       That\'s bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.   Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular.       I\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here.   An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived. I exist is derived, if you want it that way.   Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.   what is it you are trying to say?       Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or the way the world works.       Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed) says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can have interesting effects.',0

Of that, a  substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I\'ll be interested.  After you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra equipment is going to cost.       First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was because they _had_ to.  They don\'t like to do that as a general rule.  Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn\'t designed to do that.   Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.  Third, they don\'t have eight months.  They have however much time is left  after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved. You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it\'s realistic.  I\'m not saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).   What I\'m saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA management.    All they have to do is soup it up?  Just what does that mean?       The second servicing mission is a contingency.  You have neither shown that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your plan.     No, Pat, I haven\'t forgotten.   No Pat.  That\'s $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement  costs, minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.    I\'m sure that if you reread this you\'ll see that your argument is falacious.   Pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that\'s _made_ to  perform this task, it also ignores the point.  There is a desire to have  astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done about it.  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door, you haven\'t solved the problem. ',2
602,'Well, I seem to have struck an  interesting discussion off.

612,' I don\'t necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma). Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never  state why faith and dogma are dangerous.    If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in Waco, you are missing the point.    The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed everything he said.  The problem wasn\'t the religion, it was the  followers.  They didn\'t die because of faith and dogma, they died because of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their parents).   So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their religion only?  What are you saying?  One\'s belief in a Christian God does not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at, but I\'d rather hear you expand on the subject.    Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?      So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this definition imply that one cannot change one\'s mind.  In prison, however, you can\'t just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The two are not compatible.    I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^) Seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn groups of people.

617,'     Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec.

Their latest model, the RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster.

620,'People who criticize big Government and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term.    (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov\'t was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov\'t has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)  As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn\'t it?)  But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money.  Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be.    It\'s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools.    -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368',2

624,'  First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as  capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.    If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I  presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together.  As for the issues, let\'s start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact. However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That\'s my opinion, and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.  I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I  certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.    As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what you\'re talking about.  Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and  population control.

633,'We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll get round to it eventually.  The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke the \'Little Giant\' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling.  Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections.

644,' Jonathan, interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I\'d be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think.  As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet\'s highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren\'t in front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert).  Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth\'s atmospheric density).  In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a  pressure suit there, or you\'d die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?',2

663,'molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.   While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing.   This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment.   Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological            sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art            computer graphics into their research; computer scientists            wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of            scientific visualization.              The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a            first-come first-served basis.   Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken            without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra            and introductory chemistry required.

666,'A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland     on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near     Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part     was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They     were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became     enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle     of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby     forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were     visible till morning sunrise.      The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in     Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in     the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was     only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.     A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a     spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about     five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the     upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of     the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright     spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails     were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still     visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.      The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don\'t know if     there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near     Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969     we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of     these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium     experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we     have observed 17 satellite launches.      Leo Wikholm',2

674,'    This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,    anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far    as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.    That\'s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution    to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well    known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)    are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...  Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy, except it doesn\'t explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars.  Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but that uses pretty far-out physics.  My point is that we don\'t have a good mechanism at any distance, so GRB\'s are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can\'t rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren\'t quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the Tunguska Meteorite was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well.  The fact that we don\'t know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn\'t a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB\'s.  If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can\'t constrain any Oort- cloud GRB\'s at all.',2

1076,'     Anton LaVey\'s interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I read his Satanic Bible a few years ago for a social studies project, as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called The Cult of Devil Worship in America.  The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self.    When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I don\'t consider LaVey\'s church to be at all orthodox, nor do I consider its followers satanists.  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche, Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan. No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.  At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr. and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the  way.)    I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster\'s Dictionary and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.',0
681,' Rome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle, and she said Worship Cybele and you\'ll be saved. They did, they were.  Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son & lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian, from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.  It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater), could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black, prob. IS connected to that Ka\'aba they\'ve got in Mecca, 3rd cent.

682,'[ There are actually some talk.abortion related comments below, believe it or   not... ]   Well, if our observer X is as likely to be in A\'s position as B\'s, and if he agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences regarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is no right answer.  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.  If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.  It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from all perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my perspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to life; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what they like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in favour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This is also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own decisions (within reason).  And for what it\'s worth, I am reasonably happy with current UK abortion law.  Similarly, the situation in what\'s left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and I really can\'t see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don\'t even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage. ',3
683,' This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\'s atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive answer is photosynthesis, but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis by itself can\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material.  On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).  This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.  There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\'s atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn\'t be here to be wondering about it.',2

I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available.

The inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat), thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped down own)..

We have all, I\'m sure, seen Postol\'s interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about the Patriot\'s effectiveness; what is your source for the 70\% effectiveness you claim?

712,' If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by  experiment and observation, then I would agree with you, Chris.   The burden of proof would belong to Bill. But the source document for Christianity, the Bible, simply assumes God exists and makes it clear (to us Calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a person is in fellowship with God, it is because God has taken the initiative in revealing Himself to that person. So from a Christian point of view, the burden of proof belongs to God. Bill is being consistent with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God, but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct, causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God.   Please excuse me if I missed an earlier part of this thread in which Bill came across like an egotist.

713,'This response originally fell into a bit bucket.  I\'m reposting it just so Bill doesn\'t think I\'m ignoring him.   Bill,  I\'m sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this.  Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism needn\'t imply materialism, or the lack of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and don\'t believe in absolute morality, so I\'ll answer your questions.   An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don\'t believe in an absolute one doesn\'t mean that I don\'t have one.  I\'m just explicit, as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I object to genocide, I\'m not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds.  If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving considerable survival advantages.  You\'d probably say that God just made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early childhood teaching.   I think you\'ve been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you\'re saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites is mechanistic, but of course I think that\'s true of you as well.  My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him good, which is supposedly an attribute of God.   Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with, and say this is good, even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as excluded from discussion, such that they cannot participate, and their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort of someone who can\'t rationally defend their own ideas of right, wrong, and the Bible. --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

Generally, the discussion comes down to the contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against Islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly as a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it offensive, without fear of persecution or death.    I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an interesting position, because I think this is a fine book, only incidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I\'m damned if I can find anything malevolently offensive in it.  Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book and had called it such things as filth and lies, I would rank Rushdie\'s book with Hitler\'s Mein Kempf or worse, and so on. Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to believe that few of them have actually read it].

First, you are discussing only experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense.  Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. The observation of a fossil is \'repeatable\', since any qualified observer may look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also, there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.  Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles, rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).  So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the necessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the original event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural, real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot, you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for, you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still, I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information, as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article How to find sources. (If you don\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body.  The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful --- it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for canned software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don\'t see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work, you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20, that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files, and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you\'ll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool, and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG, NewAmyJPEG, VJPEG, and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it\'s hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\'t forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article How to find sources, referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\'d like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer, color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already, so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing, and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read, it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why, it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

They had advertised that they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room of the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to the lecture.  There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one woman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of them. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read straight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars (English?) from the thirteenth century.  The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a fairy-tale teller\'s voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to me. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something. What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, then that we couldn\'t become divine as the persons we are currently, but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I\'ve read too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your friends_ in _Prometheus rising_.   It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to be a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain power and admiration.

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  Galactic Pot-Healer A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  A Maze of Death Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  VALIS The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  The Divine Invasion God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  The Handmaid\'s Tale A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it right again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  The Bible This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you\'ll know what all the fuss is about.

A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area.  Argues both for negative atheism (i.e. the non-belief in the existence of god(s)) and also for positive atheism (the belief in the non-existence of god(s)).

Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments.  Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism, Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea, the belief that God exists.  316 pages.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  The Existence of God (Revised Edition), Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism (1977) and was concluded with Faith and Reason (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie\'s The Miracle of Theism.  In the revised edition of The Existence of God, Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  The Miracle of Theism, Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as replacements for God such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

751,'Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and relaunching it:  (Caution: speculation mode engaged) There is another consideration that hasn\'t been mentioned yet. I expect that retrieving HST would involve \'damaging\' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don\'t \'ring\' due to thermal cycle stresses...)  I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged (I assume that they were caged for launch)?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Corvin \t      \t\t\t\tzwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com GN&C R&D\t\t\t\t\tMartin Marietta Astronautics ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ===============    My views, not Martin Marietta\'s   ========================',2

1199,'I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I would like to automate the procedure.  The problem is that XV can\'t (I think) convert images automatically, and the obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don\'t even get close to XV\'s quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the public domain? If so, where?  ',1

758,' Bill, I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of  belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that  for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.  I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might  revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.  Cheers, Kent ',0
759,'Please help.  I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little, which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.  I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.  I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc., all to no avail.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I\'ll have to but I thought that the death of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened.  I didn\'t want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they\'ll say: Yep, you gotta have this replaced and it\'s gonna cost you $???.  I\'ve only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it\'s a 386SX @ 20 MHz.

I\'m not opposed to having it replaced, but I\'d rather not if it\'s not absolutely necessary.  If you wouldn\'t mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu but if you\'d rather post I\'ll be checking back here in a couple of days.

The outer planets are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on the way to Neptune.  Don\'t judge interplanetary trajectories in general by what the Voyagers did:  they exploited a lineup that occurs only every couple of centuries, and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect route to Neptune.

Now, I have made my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and  with Khomeini\'s supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.   I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and  other such opaque concepts often used by people to camoflage the  baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology.

766,' That\'s fascinating.  I take it that you\'re expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here\'s some more:     Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding    fathers, but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany    Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the    Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,    and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion    Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were    revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the    American psyche.    ...       By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the    Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited    forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors    on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged    his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at    Albany Congress: It would be a strange thing...if six nations    of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union    and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted    for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should    be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.       According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs    and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he    acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.  Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation_ addresses this issue.',0

For example, is : >there a constant sensation of falling?   Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied: : Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first, : but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that : of sky diving.  I\'m no astronaut, but I\'ve flown in the KC-135 several times.  I\'ll tell you about my first flight.  At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold).  At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the return of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn\'t really pay attention to physiology at that time.  After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I\'ve discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don\'t get sick on the thing.)  I didn\'t think of it as a constant sensation of falling so much as like swimming in air.  It\'s very close to the sensations I feel when I\'m scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.  Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?   Ron: : It is the body\'s reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be : induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. : Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more : prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental : part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is : up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay : pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is above the head of : the astronauts.  About 50\% of the astronauts experience some form of : motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to : see how to keep the number of occurances down.  I\'m a volunteer in JSC\'s Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do, among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual aids.  The goal was to measure the victim\'s^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject\'s responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness symptoms.

McElwaine, Physicist                           Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody knew that a            heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would            violate the laws of physics.  All of the experts and            authorities said so.                            For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  The            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of            force, can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be.                            Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright            Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final            word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they            crash).                            Today, orthodox physicists and other scientists are            saying similar things against several kinds of \'Free Energy\'            Technologies, using negative terms such as pseudo-science            and perpetual motion, and citing so-called laws which            assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed (1st law            of thermodynamics) and there is always a decrease in useful            energy (2nd law of thermodynamics).  The physicists do not            know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare            that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF            IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern science and help to            cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox            modern theories.                            Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-           OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT            SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated            pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment.                            Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy,            but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by            various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices,            they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they            can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy            has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and            often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly            designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                            For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058,            #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for            motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earth\'s magnetic            field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to            be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in            Science & Mechanics magazine, Spring 1980, (Amazing            Magnet-Powered Motor, by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117,            and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes,            orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such            a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible            heatpump in one\'s home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a \'SPARK GAP\' in the circuit            which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped.  It is important that the total            \'inductance\' and \'capacitance\' of the Device combine to            \'RESONATE\' at the same frequency as \'EARTH RESONANCE\' in            order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be            increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \'NEUTRAL CENTER\'            of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a            Tesla Coil, slipping a \'TOROID CHOKE COIL\' around the            secondary coil will enhance output power.  [Earth Energy:            Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems, by John Bigelow, 1976,            Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.]                            During the 1930\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named            Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an            \'IMPLOSION TURBINE\' (German name, \'ZOKWENDLE\'), after            analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped            waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it.  As described in the book A            Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources, by Dan A. Davidson,            1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a            LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump,            which then converts the pump\'s motor into an ELECTRIC            GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earth\'s rotation, via the \'Coriolis effect\', LIKE A            TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                            A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \'McClintock            Air Motor\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between            a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and            planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running            by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also            generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat            buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large            trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.             [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the            automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.]                            Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown            in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector.                            One other energy source should be mentioned here,            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free            Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph            Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION            reactor which he calls \'Migma\', which uses NON-radioactive            deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities            from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be            converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting            steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the            Tokamaks and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about,            Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in.  [New Times (U.S. version), 6-26-78,            pages 32-40.]                            And then there are the \'cold fusion\' experiments that            have been in the news lately, originally conducted by            University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin            Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake            Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of            chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with            mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which            PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated.                            There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called laws            of thermodynamics are NOT so absolute.  For example, the            late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \'Reciprocal System\', (which he describes in detail            in several books such as Nothing But Motion (1979) and The            Universe of Motion (1984)), in which the physical universe            has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter            half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing            between them, with-OUT the heat death predicted by            thermodynamic laws.  His Theory explains the universe MUCH            BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some            Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow,            seemingly converting low-quality energy into high-quality            energy.                            Also, certain religious organizations such as \'Sant Mat\'            and \'Eckankar\' teach their Members that the physical universe            is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of            existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV            channels, as described in books like The Path of the            Masters, by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and Eckankar: The Key            to Secret Worlds, by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example,            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the \'Astral Plane\'.  Long-time Members of these groups            have learned to \'Soul Travel\' into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given            the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is            supported by many successful laboratory-controlled            experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as            those described in the book Psychic Discoveries Behind the            Iron Curtain.                            In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional            energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their            VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If            the government does not intervene, then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and            pollution and its harmful effects (including the \'GREENHOUSE            EFFECT\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil            spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue            to increase.                            The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development            of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize            private production (until the producers can make it on their            own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of            Free Energy Hardware.                            The long-range effects of such government intervention            would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining            companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$,            etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil,            and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero,            while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\'s,            personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease,            along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be            able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE            USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                            Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of            business, but society as a whole, and the earth\'s environment            and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People,            that government should serve, rather than the big            corporation$ and bank$.

791,'   I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume that the general public can\'t handle the truth and then, based on this  assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a good argument, comes along and asks why don\'t you just develop the spinoffs? or why can\'t we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the military?  There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects.  I\'m not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.   And if you\'re going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.

792,'  Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories.  There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same errors.  This would appear to tell us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don\'t know what they did before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.  You\'re basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people like to use the game of telephone as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.',0

798,'RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992  \t\tWHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE  I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC  \tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  Tribulation.  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be  saved. - Matthew 24:13  II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION  \tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ\'s second coming.  Also know as the time of Jacob\'s (Israel\'s) trouble (Jere 30:7) and Daniel\'s Seventieth Week (Dan 9), this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.  III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM  \tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community  (the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable  possession during the Tribulation.  IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  \tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24,  Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you.    V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  \tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray  and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ.    VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS  \tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell, or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be useless.  And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and  slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast,  or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666 - Revelation 13:16-18.   \tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past, such as the Holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -M] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\'s rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ...I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of  them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer,  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed. Revelation 6:9, 11. \tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ...And I saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of  God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands. - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children,  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark.   \tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire. [Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M] You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire.  ...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His  indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. -Revelation  14:9-10   [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --M]   VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL  \tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\'s government until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake. \tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the Antichrist\'s control will come last to the least populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation. [As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings --M]  Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [Get a good water filter. --M] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights, batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.  VIII. TRUST NO ONE \t \tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\'s government.  Be on the lookout. [Perot supporters take note --M]  IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST  \tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be  physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and  personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived. [Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M] \tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.   All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.  X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!  \tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you  will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.   \tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of  your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be faithful unto death.  \tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!  ****************************************************************************** Mike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  Christianity is Stupid. v22964qs@ubvms or mike\%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up. -Negativland UB Language Perception Laboratory\t*   ******************************************************************************   //////////////////////////////////   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.',0

800,'  If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you love vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn\'t even think of flying it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform.   Not to this degree.   Why?   Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle isn\'t reusable, it\'s salvagable).   The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.   The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80\% of available thrust and still land safely.   Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that\'s not the same thing. Shuttle simply isn\'t a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.   You don\'t put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You wouldn\'t for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you?   You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO.   Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn\'t. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn\'t.   Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will carry passengers.   I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.   Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for opponents of manned space to kill it.   The only way to prove those things is to build it.    Allen ',2

It    There\'s nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90\'s.    Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the cracker ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.      That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.    I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists, where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves hackers allowing this to perpetuate itself?

Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn\'t even buy a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.   Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs.

810,'Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must discount every other book of antiquity:   Mr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every historical document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself that.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical document, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to Peter.   I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you reject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by Matthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were carved with the Pharoah\'s specific approval so we have true originals, rather than mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285 BC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo).  The Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops.   Note that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person.  The following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume II.  \tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall \ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into \tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin; \tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and \tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking \tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors \tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth, \tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.  (Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses divine word, but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of  battle.)  \tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces \tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other \twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and \tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...  \tNo officer was with me, no charioteer, \tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; \tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them, \tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them. \tHis majesty spoke: What is this, father Amun? \tIs it right for a father to ignore his son? \tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore? \tDo I not walk and stand at your word? \tI have not neglected an order you gave. \tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt, \tTo allow aliens to step on his path! \tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun, \tThe wretches ignorant of god? \tHave I not made for you many great monuments, \t... \tI call to you, my father Amun, \tI am among a host of strangers; \tAll countries are arrayed against me, \tI am alone, there\'s none with me! \t... \tThe labors of many people are nothing, \tAmun is more helpful than they; \tI came here by the command of your mouth, \tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!  \tNow though I prayed in a distant land, \tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes. \tI found Amun came when I called to him, \tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced. \tHe called from behind as if near by: \tForward, I am with you, \tI your father, my hand is with you, \tI prevail over a hundred thousand men, \tI am lord of victory, lover of valor! \tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy, \tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont. \t... \tI slaughtered among them at my will, \tNot one looked behind him, \tNot one turned around, \tWhoever fell down did not rise. \t... \tOne called out to the other saying: \tNo man is he who is among us, \tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; \tNot deeds of man are these his doings, \tThey are of one who is unique, \tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots, \tCome quick, flee before him, \tTo seek life and breathe air; \tFor he who attempts to get close to him, \tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp. \tOne cannot hold either bow or spears, \tWhen one sees him come racing along! \tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin, \tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.  So you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous  battle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being *completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words:       question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,      Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?  Do you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your all or nothing approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter (and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all, forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible.   As to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he must be true:    I have three points.    First, this is argumentum ad populum (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu\'s past and present who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for the existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of Hindus:  \tWith a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of  \t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete  \t hooey?  If you do so scoff, then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading?  Second, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to Jesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true.   Third, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that he had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was much discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a deist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I\'ve previously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc.    \t\t\t\tLater,  \t\t\t\tDave Butler',3
811,'  This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists\' expertise.  This is probably because of the research mind approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done.  The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is, Get the money from NSF.  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.    Also, the government decided that the wealth should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.',2

817,' No, this is far from clear.  We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that a survivor made this claim.  We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.  In the absense of any more evidence, I don\'t see how we can decide who to believe. Furthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else. With the state of the area now, we may never know what happened.   Again, we have only the word of the FBI on this claim.  The lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim.   I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities.  Its more likely that the BD\'s started the fire than did the FBI.  But there is currently NO way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence (which is nearly none).      D.   The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs.  I am truely amazed that         I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.         With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and         the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.         I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or         accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.  With the winds, it         would have quickly gotten out of control.      No, I think that D is also quite reasonable.  I personally can\'t really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or BD) over intential setting of the fire).     I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they\'ve reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I\'ve read and heard.     In short, there\'s been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical until more information is available.     -- ',3

819,'  Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of. The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread  of humans.  (**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction  (*) about 800 families  Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first, ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms (pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land.   (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families) (2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families) (3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)  It\'s unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down.  (***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were.   See Cowen\'s book History of Life for a not-too-technical run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.

Clarke  Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9   This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them.     Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate reflections of their particular era\'s dreams, abilities, and knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences.  This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship.  SPECIAL FEATURES  Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional  Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives  An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the \'pristine\' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.

835,' First and foremost, I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago.  I know your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did, but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.  Period.  I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a \'cultural virus\' that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from there.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many other people believe in it, it must be right, no?  I don\'t believe in any life after death.  I believe that when I die, I die, so therefore it\'s up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime.  I don\'t believe that it\'s a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a constructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the \'faults\' of these opinions to me.  I don\'t believe in \'loving everyone\', especially people I\'ve never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my love and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it.  If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop trying to show me how the Bible makes sense.  Start trying to show me that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone\'s life here on Earth. ',3

841,'  When Robert refers to the orthodox, he is talking about the Historical position of the Christian Faith. Such things are derived from Biblcal texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.  You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs, there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be. According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.',3

843,'I\'m working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I\'m using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH \'84 proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form (x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at (x,y,z).  The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I\'ve tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I\'m quite certain - I think :) - that I\'ve not simply made an implementation error...)  Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.

Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle  : bring them down to use as spares?  One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME\'s, you don\'t have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME\'s are just dead weight, since we don\'t have an SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means that you can\'t use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.  Throw-away SSME\'s might let us use some of the old SSME\'s which are not- quite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we\'d do that; the cost of a launch failure is too high.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368',2
852,'      Hmm... there must be two towns with the same name.  Kaliningrad, located just North of Moscow is correct.  It is the home of several Russian space enterprises, including NPO Energia, Krunichev, Fakel, and Tsniimach.  The main Russian manned spacecraft control facility is also located here.    Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tours can be arranged.  Call ahead though, there are still armed military guards at many of these facilities -- who don\'t speak English, aren\'t well paid, and are rather bored.

853,'   Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many \'similar\' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?  Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd.  So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:    In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.  As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If that was not what you meant, then:   Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was.

858,' Actually, I find the stuff about JC being a carpenter more interesting.  Is there an independent source for this assertion, or is it all from the Christian Bible?  Is there any record at all of anything he built?  A table, a house, some stairs (Norm Abrams says the real test of a carpenter\'s skill is building stairs with hand tools).  Did he leave any plans behind for, say kitchen counters and cabinets?  Did he build his own cross? If so, did he use pressure-treated lumber?  Gotta use that pressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but it holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.

859,'  Yup.  Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right).  I can\'t remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG\'s to GIF\'s before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards. You don\'t need any special hardware to view JPEG\'s except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a 8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIF\'s and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way gives a brighter more detailed image.  Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as far as I know, you don\'t need extra hardware to view JPEG\'s other than the VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)  Have a day!',1

Every time these right-wing control-freaks start spouting about prayer in schools, I get this nagging commentary from the Sermon on the Mount [Matt: 6:5-6] And when you pray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street corners for people to see them.  I tell you solemnly, they have had their reward.  But when you pray, go to your private room and, when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in that secret place.  But no.

882,'  You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)  However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )  I suppose that the right to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.',2

884,'930425   Let\'s start with the name Rosicrucian. I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a rosicrucian body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some \'rosicrucians\' you mean members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian. At least that is what your observation suggests :-)   Response:  This makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions. There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves \'Hindus\' or \'Christians\' or \'Pagans\' and actually *BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other \'religions\'.  I find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that \'mysticism\' is the core of every religion and Huxley\'s \'Perennial Philosophy\' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>   Tony:  I\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, most members does not *necessarily* mean best.   Response:  Certainly true.  I didn\'t know there WERE any groups which called themselves \'Rosicrucians\' that didn\'t associate with AMORC.  Sure, I\'ve heard all the hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these Western esoteric groups, but hadn\'t heard about other \'Rosicrucians\'. I\'ll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>   Tony:  You\'ll have to trust me when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you\'d probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO.    Response:  This may be slightly off.  I\'ve met some of these Rosicrucians and have a couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I\'ve heard and the slight contact I\'ve had with them does not give me the hope that I\'d be received with any kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.) are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a \'cast\'.   Tony:        It is curious to know that 3 other RC \'orders\' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*.   Response:  I\'d like to know at least the addresses of the \'other orders\' which call  themselves \'Rosicrucians\' and especially those which are \'nonsectarian\'. Is this \'nonsectarian\' like the Masons, who require that a member \'believe in God by his/her definition\'?              Tony:  I don\'t see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with us containing something divine... And yes I don\'t like phrases like eternal bliss either! :-)   Response:  Let alone us *BEING* something divine. ;>   Tony:  BTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free of charge.

887,'It is interesting to note in the past few days\' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not.  The \'spaceport political publicity\' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don\'t think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm, believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar.

894,'  According to this reasoning there are no rights, at least none that I can think  of....  Let\'s see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.  Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning. I could go on with these examples for a long time....  Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks, and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized,  imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was  good for them.  I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority, is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn\'t mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.

We should _persude_ people  by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.  Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people? The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.  Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live for?    I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both. I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.

I.e. she was trapped in the language of Kant and Hegel, even though she was trying to say (at times) much different things. ',2
898,' I suppose you don\'t know what about we have discussed. We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn\'t tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There\'s no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.    Ok, you\'re writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesn\'t work, because there\'s no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don\'t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there\'s need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don\'t see full 24bit image, there\'s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok, I don\'t have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...    It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where \'up\' means that the lift goes down and \'down\' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn\'t solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :)   Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to read it. ',1
899,' Supernovae put out 10^53 or 10^54 (i forget which, but it\'s only an order of magnitude...).  Not in gamma rays, though.  You\'d hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic  (but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can\'t think of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.  Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That\'s just in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but bursts? Nah.

Dear Prospective Employer:  I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware,  C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and computer networking.  I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992  from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.  During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics. These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability to learn new concepts quickly.  I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level.  I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS. I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant, am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform  GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in computer networking.  While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication. I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.  My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.

1289,'In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words  translated into the word hell.  These Greek words have totally different  meanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.      In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the  New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol... meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be  likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)      Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.        Why?  Because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the  traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never  remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!      In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of  the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of  shadowy realm.  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to  this hell.      The second hell of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in  scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast  them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be  reserved unto judgment...      Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14;  Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels  (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to  Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the  mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).      Tartaros, then, is a hell that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe  the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible  is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell.      The the third word that is translated as hell in the Bible is Gehenna. It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning valley of Hinniom.  Hinnom is a  deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.      In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including  infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made  their children pass through the fire to the god Molech.  The rites were  specifically celebrated in Tophet, the place of abhorrence, one of the chief  groves in the valley).      King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He  defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later  the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for  sewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were  also burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding  by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.      Aceldama, the field of blood, purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.      So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?        In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working  religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the  re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming. Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: And the beast was taken, and with  him the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire  burning with brimstone.          Where will this temporary lake of fire (this hell) be?      The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: For  Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is  prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood,  the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it (Isa.30:33).      One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled  fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).      But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible  say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of  fire?      In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be  thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will  become of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity?        The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna  fire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This  punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the  second death (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a  further resurrection.      The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.                                 The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. For, behold, the day  cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do  wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up... (4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be ashes under the  soles of your feet...(Mal.4:3).      Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living  torture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or  valley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left,  but ashes!       Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means  complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The  Bible says, in Romans 6:23, The wages of sin is death, not eternal life in  torture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of  life. ',3

915,' Probably because it IS rape.   So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn\'t give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even particularly attractive.   Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.   This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or one\'s ignorance.  Someone else will address this I\'m sure, and refer you to plenty of documentation...   How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.   Well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.  If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will feel right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction... I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness. --   --Adam',0

918,'  I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I don\'t think Plato would have been happy with this, and neither would Paul, although Paul\'s ideas were quite different. However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements.  The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don\'t believe in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.   Ah, you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed all along.    You might be as well planting Satan\'s seeds, ever thought of this? Besides, you haven\'t yet explained why we must believe so blindly, without any guiding light at all (at least I haven\'t noticed it). I don\'t think this is at all fair play on god\'s part.   Your argument sounds like a version of Pascal\'s Wager. Please read the FAQ, this fallacy is discussed there.   And I failed to get help from the HS because I had a wrong attitude?

So I wonder if there exists  public domain source code for this.      Another \'rough\' solition (don\'t care special cases) is ray-casting  which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces  consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used (M.

How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case.

934,' I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination, grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity.  At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don\'t say it couldn\'t happen to you, or that it hasn\'t happened to others, even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.  Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.',0
935,' Wow! You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as guilt and  morality.  I\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\'t for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be  absolutely impossible.  Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to  attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\'t  illegal, then don\'t pick on me).  I\'m not saying this is wrong, merely  that it is a byproduct of a society which has:  \t1) A high education level, \t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media, \t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and \t4) A me oriented culture.  I guess what I\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition,  here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can can\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we  are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  those freedoms don\'t impinge on another\'s.  IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we  appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old  territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized,  inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the  continued destabilization of society.    I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this  mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms  in order to stabilize society.  Yet I believe development of societies  follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a  social model which maximizes indiv. freed.\'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is  possible to live with a non-stable society?  Anybody see a way out?  Comments?  PS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don\'t.  Do we want to?    Phil Trodwell ',0
936,'  Yes.  Here\'s what you should do.  Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay, but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it, so you don\'t have to transform any vertex more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don\'t have to be transformed at all.  Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it\'s on the far side of the hither plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.  Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage. ',1

940,'    Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined rules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented at the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for that case would be the citizens of the US and so on.   Acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are non-verbally and, in effect, non-consciously, such as picking your nose on the Oprah Winfrey show, no-one does it, but there is no explicit law against doing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a behaviour is acceptable, but one can deduce these behaviours by observation.    In an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, some cultures\' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals. Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, is it moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind of problem may only be definable by legislation.   Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is acceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.    One thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit all cultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally accepted mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable concept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon this earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).',0

943,' Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church historicly never has.  Let\'s consider some personal interpretations and see how much trust we should put in Orthodox Mormonism, which could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.          In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie said they thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah. He also said Christians are wrong to believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity [God the Father], and that Christ came into mortality as His Only Begotten Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter. He said that Elohim is the Father and Jehovah is the Son.    Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists   have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise   to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to   identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the   promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the   Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As   with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the   Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy   Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was   born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.   (Promised Messiah, p. 100)          Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their three-in-one God and their belief that God is a Spirit as they are in their understanding of who Elohim and Jehovah are. Before examining McConkie\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words Elohim and Jehovah. McConkie stated:    ...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in   the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the   exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)    _Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted   name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his   supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon   Doctrine, p. 224)          Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who Elohim and Jehovah are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:    _Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus   Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn   Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,   Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)          A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve apostles of the Mormon Church states that God the Eternal Father...[is] designate[d] by the exalted name-title \'Elohim\'... (Articles of Faith, p. 466) ...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state...was known as Jehovah... (Articles of Faith, p. 471)          Today Mormon leaders teach that Elohim in the OT refers to God the Father and Jehovah refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians for saying Jehovah can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two name-titles should not be changed around so that Christ is called Elohim and the Father is called Jehovah. ...the Father...is Elohim, not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one and the same person. (Promised Messiah, p. 111)          In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word Elohim is used to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges of Israel. When referring to the true God, Elohim is translated with a capital G. When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel, it is translated with a small g. It is translated four times as judges (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as judge (1 Sam. 2:25), twice as mighty (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as angels (Ps. 8:5), once as godly (Mal. 2:15), once as great (Gen. 30:8), and once as very great. (1 Sam. 14:15)          The word Jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word Adonai.  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since Jehovah rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use Jehovah instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name. Jehovah, unlike Elohim, is never used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible. In the KJV, Jehovah is rendered primarily LORD, sometimes GOD, and rarely Lord.          Now that we understand something about the words Elohim and Jehovah and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle McConkie\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is Jehovah. In trying to prove that Jehovah refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\'s interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right. Remember, McConkie said the Father is not Jehovah; He is only Elohim. The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\'s interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:    Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit   and he testified, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right   hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? (Ps. 110:1.) Two   Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater   than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of   the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this   Messianic prophecy?   What think ye of Christ? our Lord asked certain of his detractors   toward the end of his mortal ministry. Whose son is he? Is Christ   the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent   or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he   was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the   Jews. And so they answered, The Son of David.   David\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our   Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,   asked, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord   said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine   enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his   son? That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the   great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him   as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake   unto David\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is   interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \'_The   Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my   right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up   to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to   sit on my right hand forever.\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)   (emphasis added)          Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6 reads: The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the Son]... (brackets in original)          McConkie clearly stated that it is Elohim the Father who is speaking to Jehovah the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at the Hebrew word translated LORD, it becomes apparent that either the first LORD is not the Father or else the Father is Jehovah. Either way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:    The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right   hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)          The first LORD in this verse is Jehovah who Mormonism says is Christ, not the Father. The second Lord is the Hebrew word Adon (singular for Adonai, meaning master or lord). If the first LORD is the Father and the second Lord is the Son, then the Father is Jehovah and the Son is Adon. However, if the Father is not Jehovah as McConkie claimed, then the first LORD is Jehovah the Son, but who, then, is Adon? Obviously the Father is Jehovah in this Psalm, and His Son is Adon.          Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated the following:    I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, _Isaiah quoted the   Father as saying of Christ_, and will hold thine hand, and will keep   thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the   Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)          McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads:    I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold   thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the   people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)          According to McConkie, I the LORD refers to the Father, and thine and thee refer to Christ. However, the LORD who is speaking is Jehovah which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is Jehovah.          Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie stated:    shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord   that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in   him. (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is   found in these words: The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes   and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be   the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will   believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will   have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which   were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. (Matt.   27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)          Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:    All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they   shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would   deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.          McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment as Jesus hung on the cross. That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ. Who, then, was the LORD in whom he trusted? It was Jehovah the Father.          Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them, McConkie stated the following:    With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our   Lord\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: They took counsel   together against me, they devised to take away my life. (Ps. 31:13.)   Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my   bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised   Messiah, p. 532)          Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\'s arrest and judicial trials. We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter.    For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while   they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my   life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God   [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)          McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the LORD who is called His God or Elohim. Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is Elohim the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the Elohim of the man Jesus is Jehovah the Father.          In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses will be considered in this examination.    Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my   bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.   But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that   I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)          McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\' role in Christ\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the familiar friend who lifted up his heel, the pronouns mine, I, my, and me in verse 9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to thou, which refers to the LORD (Jehovah). Then the pronouns me and I which refer to Christ are used again. That means Christ was speaking to Jehovah the Father in these verses.          Another example involves McConkie\'s following remark about Ps.         110:4.    One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,   ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,   p. 450)          McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ. The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?    The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest   for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)          Does the LORD, which is Jehovah, refer to Christ? If McConkie is right and Jesus is Jehovah, but the Father is not, then the LORD would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one addressed as the priest forever after the order of Melchizedek? The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10; 6:20; 7); therefore, the LORD (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.          Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie stated:    Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...      The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....      It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)      (emphasis added)          McConkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah. However, what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is Jehovah. Verse 6 reads: All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us all, and verse 10 reads: Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise him [Christ]...          Obviously the LORD who laid on Christ the iniquity of us all and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called Jehovah in these verses.          Remember, McConkie stated that some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity, and that Christ came into mortality as His Only Begotten Son. He called this concept misinformation that is untrue. To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures:    In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of   the Seed of David: I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2   Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly   Messianic, occurs this statement: Thou art my Son; this day have I   begotten thee. (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in   Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the   Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)          McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7 refer to Christ who would come as the Son of God. Since McConkie first referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.    And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people   Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the   LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.   And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,   I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy   bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.   He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of   his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2   Sam. 7:11-14)          These verses teach that the LORD (Jehovah) would have a Son, the Messiah.         In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination will include verse 8. Notice that it is the LORD (Jehovah) who says, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.    I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou   art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.   Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,   and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.          McConkie said these verses of Scripture are clearly Messianic, and he acknowledged they teach that Christ would come as the Son of God. What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is Jehovah and that the sectarians who believe Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son is Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten, are right in their belief.          Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated the following:    And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,   this is he of whom it is written_: He shall stand and feed in the   strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his   God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. (Mic.   5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)          According to McConkie, the pronoun He at the beginning of Mic. 5:4 refers to Christ during his mortal ministry. Who, then, is the LORD his God? Mic. 5:4 reads:    And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD   [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God   [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.          Obviously the LORD of Jesus Christ is Jehovah the Father who is referred to as Jehovah his Elohim.          Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses McConkie stated the following:    A number of Messianic passages speak of the Lord, and...his   anointed (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated   and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus   applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\'s prophecy. The   Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek (Isa.   61:1), and then saying: This day is this scripture fulfilled in your   ears (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)          The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:    The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel   together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.          McConkie said the anointed one was Christ. If that is true, who was Jehovah? If Jehovah is always Christ, who was the anointed one? Obviously Jehovah is referring to God the Father and the anointed is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:    The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the   LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;   he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to   the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;          The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse says the LORD (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same problem. If Jehovah does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ, then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, Jesus applied these passages to himself. Therefore, the Jehovah who anointed Christ is God the Father.          Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not Jehovah. However, these should be enough to expose their error.          Now, what about Mormonism\'s claim that Jesus is Jehovah, but He is not Elohim? It is true that Jesus is Jehovah. The following Scriptures prove this fact:    Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer   the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and   beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)   [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and   was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)    ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have   pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only   son... (Zech. 12:1,10)   Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,   and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)    ...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.   43:3)   ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)    And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of   the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)   ...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name   under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)    Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his   reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)   ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.   22:12)    ...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with   thee. (Zech. 14:5)   ...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1   Thess. 3:13)    The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)   [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)    ...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...   (Ezek. 34:15-16)   ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.   (Luke 19:10)    For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy   Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)   Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great   God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and   Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;   Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and   Rev. 3:19)          While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah, they are wrong when they say He is not Elohim. The Bible reveals that Jehovah is the only true Elohim there is; all others are false. Remember, Jehovah is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible.          Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as Jehovah and Elohim but so is the Holy Spirit.    Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I   will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my   laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And   their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)   (emphasis on Holy Ghost and said added)   Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a   new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...   I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;   and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will   forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.   31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)    For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy   men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)   (emphasis on Holy Ghost added)   The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in   my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)          Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah and Elohim are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.    And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,   God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,   Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie   acknowledged that it was Christ\'s voice that spoke to Moses in the   burning bush... Promised Messiah, p. 394]   And the LORD [Jehovah] said...   And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the   children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your   fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his   name? what shall I say unto them?   And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus   shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto   you.   And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto   the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your   fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and   the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for   ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.   3:4,7,13-15)    And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD   [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)    I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God   [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:   (Isa. 45:5)    But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God   [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)    Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer   the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and   beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)    Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,   saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.   (Amos 5:27)    Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD\'s   [Jehovah\'s] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein   is. (Deut. 10:14)    Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is   none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,   according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)    And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],   the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.   (Jon. 1:9)    For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock   save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)    Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...   (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)    Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God   [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,   fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his   understanding. (Isa. 40:28)    The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and   called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down   thereof. (Ps. 50:1)    Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that   rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.   68:4) [Regarding the word Jah, Bruce R. McConkie stated: Jah   (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all   of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel. Mormon   Doctrine, p. 391]    And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from   Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose   name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that   dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)    ...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is   his name. (Jer. 32:18)    O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the   wind....   Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD   [Jehovah]....   That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most   high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)          The Bible clearly teaches that Jehovah is Elohim. In fact, He is the only Elohim there is. He is the true, the living, the mighty, the great, and the everlasting Elohim. He is the Elohim of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon. Jehovah\'s name is Elohim of hosts. (Amos 5:27)          Not only is Jehovah, Elohim, but Elohim is Jehovah. The Bible reveals that Elohim\'s name is Jah (Ps. 68:4), Jehovah (Ps. 83:18), and Jehovah of hosts. (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation whose Elohim is Jehovah is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not the Jehovah and Elohim of the Mormons.          Another Mormon error regarding Elohim and Jehovah is the belief that Elohim, not Jehovah, is the Father of all the spirits, including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage, A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve apostles states that God the Eternal Father...\'Elohim,\' is the literal Parent of...the spirits of the human race. (p. 466) This Doctrinal Exposition also states explicitly that Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of Elohim. (p. 473)          The Apostle Talmage stated that _Elohim_...is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_-- (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)          The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this matter: ...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to placing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the Father himself became personally involved. All things were created by the Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned. (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)          Mormon leaders claim that Jehovah-Christ did not create either man\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon Elohim, who is the father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the truth about who created man.    And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,   Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all   flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also   16:20-23) (emphasis added)    ...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth   the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within   him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)    ...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)    For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for   the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have   made_....   ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on souls...I   have made added)    Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...   (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)    Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee   from the womb_.   I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)   (emphasis added)    Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...   I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)   (emphasis added)    ...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...   Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD   [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.   4:32,35)    Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the   earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the   people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)    ...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of   Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon   the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)          The Bible reveals that it is Jehovah who is the Elohim of the spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself, that it was He who formed the spirit of man within him, that He made us this soul and formed us from the womb. He did indeed create man.          If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is Jehovah, then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are wrong when they say he is not Jehovah.          Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man, Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:    Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....   And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for   never has man believed in me as thou hast....   Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and   _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)   (emphasis added)    For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I   that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)    ...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of   Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and   all things that in them are.   Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)          D&C, 93:10 states that the worlds were made by him [Christ]; _men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him. (emphasis added)          Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving Jehovah and his creation is the belief that Jehovah had many pre-mortal spirits helping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.    That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by many of   the noble and great spirit children of the Father is evident from   go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these   materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell. (Abra.   3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,   Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other noble and   great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines   of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)          The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:    Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee   from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that   stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by   myself. (Isa. 44:24)    Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of   the sea. (Job 9:8)          Jehovah, by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.          Regarding the Mormon \'Elohim, the Apostle McConkie stated: Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon Doctrine, p. 224) He also stated that Jesus...is above all save the Father only. (Promised Messiah, p. 363)          The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called gods is the triune God Jehovah.    For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above   all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)    For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art   exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)    Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods   [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)          If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jehovah is god the son and Elohim is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie clearly stated, Mormons believe Elohim the father, not Jehovah the son, is the God above all Gods -- that Jesus is above all except the father; yet the Bible teaches that Jehovah is above all Elohim.          At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus:    Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly   to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been   developed....   This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the   Father, and to him only....   ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;   it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With   the Lord, pp. 19-20)          McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons pray to the Father, not the Son... On p. 306 of the same book McConkie states that Christ [the Son] is Jehovah. This is important to remember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is Jehovah, the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to Jehovah, and He not only heard those prayers, but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to Jehovah.    In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my   God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came   before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)    And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy   supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this   house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine   eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)    And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our   supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD   [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)    O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to   the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who   desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)    And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this   prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before   the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his   hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)    He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed   unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)    Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God   [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy   tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)    I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I   said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and   thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.   For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when   thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)          Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the godly pray to Jehovah. According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not pray.          The Bible reveals there is only one true Elohim, and His name is Jehovah. All other Elohim are false. They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true Elohim and idolatry.    For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to   be feared above all gods [Elohim].   For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD   [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)    Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)    Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods   [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)    And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God   [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and   worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish. (Deut. 8:19)    Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].   They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:   for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto   thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)    Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn   aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)    That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;   neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to   swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.   (Josh. 23:7)    ...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)    But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God   [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)    And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,   which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods   [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about   them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]   to anger. (Jud. 2:12)    Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods   [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I   will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know   that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)    And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you   this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your   fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods   [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my   house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].   And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should   forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.   24:15-16)          These verses teach that the only true, living Elohim in heaven and on earth is Jehovah -- the triune God who made heaven and earth and all therein.          Jehovah is greater than any Elohim, because all other Elohim are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17) Jehovah Elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false Elohim. He told His people not to have any Elohim but Him. He told the people that if they left Him for the false Elohim, those Elohim would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and would perish. He warned the people to take heed that their heart be not deceived into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making covenants with false Elohim. Jehovah Elohim told His people He would eventually judge all false Elohim and their followers.          Despite these warnings and guidelines, Elohim\'s covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false Elohim\'s of the people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods [Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim] of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.          This examination has shown that the Elohim of Mormonism, like the Elohim in Ju. 10:6 is not the true Jehovah Elohim. Therefore, the people who leave the true Elohim for the Mormon Elohim will do evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].          Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father [Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is triune; He is Spirit; He is Jehovah; and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind.          It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who thrash around in...darkness about who Elohim and Jehovah are. One wonders what Holy Writ McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son. He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one Jehovah Elohim. He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as Jehovah.  Summary          Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\'s statement that the Mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry.          In answer to Jesus\' question, But whom say ye that I am, Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in another Jesus whom Paul warned about.          Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (p. 26)          The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore, they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God. (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God, because the true names of Deity can be applied to false concepts of God. (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave a new conception of God and the Godhead. (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p. 1)          It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.    ...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from   me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD   [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)    And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God   [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and   worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely   perish. (Deut. 8:19)    Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)    ...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be   clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)    ...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)          It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible. If they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and idolatry. Remember, to know the only true God is eternal life. (John 17:3)',3

That you don\'t recognize the Biblical commentary used.  Those in the church know the language though, and have no such excuse.     You missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and  Revelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special event -- a wedding.   How are you able to make such a conclusion?  Please note, that the first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those in the church. That said, it doesn\'t hurt to try to see what the  prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.   So you say. It should be interesting to see what the investigators  conclude, and what the final judgments are.   So much for war and government eh.   Very glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19:  (here from NIV)  \tBecause of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord \thave been encouraged to speak the word of God more \tcourageously and fearlessly.  \tIt is true that some preach Christ out of envy and  \trivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so \tin love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel.  \tThe former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not \tsincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for \tme while I am chains. But what does it matter?   \tThe important thing is that in every way, whether from \tfalse motives or true, Christ is preached. And because \tof this I rejoice. \t My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are human and imperfect. Whatever we preach, no matter how eloquent, or how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master\'s voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the  lesson of the stumblingblock. For those who have an ear to hear. \t',3

One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be interpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example The best thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement.  whatever helps this goal is moral, whatever does not is immoral  Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to fulfill a goal, one would need a hyper-morality to apply to just the methods.   Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think about it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut reaction...  Which?

951,'   Apparently you *didn\'t* read the whole thing.  You continue to miss the point.    [deletions]    Counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides *abortion* information.  How about providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what *she* is comfortable with.  Your adoption-funding idea may be a good one.  Any idea if it is feasable?     Making adoption easier on the birth-mother may help reduce abortion, but it will *not* eliminate the need for it.  Abortion is not done just because the mother can\'t care for the child and doesn\'t feel good about giving it to strangers.  Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the *pregnancy*.        Then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable. And why that includes the unborn.     No, they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society.  Even if they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future--until which they are a burden on someone, or society.  There is also the matter of the mother.  Forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being a productive member of society.       Ok, look.  It\'s like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will take choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice C.  They can\'t afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we\'d have to pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they take choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen not to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid for for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can\'t in conscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly legal, but it hasn\'t been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded but some people object.  They don\'t like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those women who can\'t afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice B or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don\'t see any reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing personal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is what the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that* is what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A, and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being *lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your objections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down, as I\'m sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another--like our massive debt.)      Those other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them. (In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.) This is quite different from the case of abortion.   This is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing to make the alternative affordable too.  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then* your statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn\'t. If Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left it out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be quite surprised.    Yes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.   YOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the one who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.   Your humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering college, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few months...things that have a massive impact on her future productivity.)     You *can* have a conversation with the mentally incompetant.  And even though *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just don\'t like, it is still *possible* for others to have a conversation with them.  It is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with a fetus.    He was still biologically independent.  At least to the same extent you are now.  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  He breathed his own air.  A fetus on the other hand, gets it\'s nutrients already digested by the mother.  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  That is not biologically independent.    Awareness is only *part* of what makes a member of society.  It is the minimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven\'t seen a real justification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient being.

The other x three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the  resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of  the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the  differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small  component to the positional error.    Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would  require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort  cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together  now: Parallax ARc SECond, a parsec is the distance of an object  that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we\'re going to  have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.  The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.',2

976,'        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this little problem.  I don\'t have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago, so I\'ll use that, and hope it\'s what you wanted.   This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here.         Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds, its flux is half of the peak flux.  It\'s flux is the peak flux the rest of the time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.         Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a R=8800Mpc.           We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the old standby formula:                         Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak         For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec. And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That\'s what you\'d call moderately energetic, I\'d say.

990,'    Certainly. Reference follows.   Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.  The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected.  Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.  On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point. For protanopia the point is at u\'=0.61,v\'=0.51, very close to the far red corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u\'=-4.75, v\'=1.31  Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.  So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?  This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.  *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia:  1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4) This is the new chromaticity.   The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) \'Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays\', IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5) 28-40.  You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.   Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago.  The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a help here.)  A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u\'v\' using u\' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v\' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D) find the intersection as in step 3 E) convert back from u\'v\' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable.

Would you rather have someone love : you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to : love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward : Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.  Indeed, knock and it shall be opened to you. Dan, why didn\'t this work? I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I  had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil\'s attempts to  destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy to achieve the same mental states at will.   My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.  : Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.  God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years? If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief - what it was in my case - I\'d rather quit. If god does not help me to keep the faith, I can\'t go on.   Besides, I am concerned with god\'s morality and mental health. Does she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations, guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn\'t she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture for those who can\'t believe?  I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me, she\'ll know what to do.   : Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see : that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic. : Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is : the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never : know more than you do now.   Your argument is of the type you\'ll know once you try. Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that  they had lived in a virtual reality.  What else but reason I can use? I don\'t have the spiritual means  Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible. I don\'t even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so does my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me if she wants.  : To learn you must accept that which you don\'t know.  What does this mean? To learn you must accept that you don\'t know  something, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I don\'t know, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to merely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my daily problems, would you accept this, since you can\'t know whether it is true or not?  Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent, omnipresent, and loves just about everyone. Besides, He (and She) is guiding every writer on this planet, you and me, and not just some people who write legendary stories 2000 years ago.  Your god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence.

1001,'  HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg).  That doesn\'t include the cradle that would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed.  Spacelab-J on STS-47 was 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit).   As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this was a planned for contingency.  This is not a problem for the shuttle, though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site, they still have to go to Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay.   --GaryM',2
1002,'   You have clearly demonstrated that you do not even know what my religion is in order to make that assumption.   How I can present any argument when you put your hands over your eyes and devise new irrevelant excuses each time?  The fact remains, you want to argue about something that you do not know anything about. Do you not have to learn a topic first before you can reasonably debate the topic?    Which brings us about to the start of this thread.  You began perverting Bible verses, interpreting them without investigation. For if you desired to investigate, you would have changed your tune immediately.   Thus it is clear to me.  You do not believe what I am saying because you don\'t want to check it out.   Then you must have also ignored every other post I have written to you.  This would seem to go along with your character. ',3
1003,'Hi!  We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from  whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps something else ?  The question is, where can I find some information about this language ? A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ?  (OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I\'m not THAT optimistic...)  Thanks in advance for any help!  \tjussi  ',1
1004,':   : well, i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering : them.  as for changing them back into negatives, is that really possible?  : (stuff deleted)  : jennifer urso:  the oh-so bitter woman of utter blahness(but cheerful : undertones)  I use Aldus Photostyler on the PC and I can turn a colour or black and white image into a negative or turn a negative into a colour or black and white image.  I don\'t know how it does it but it works well.  To test it I scanned a negative and used Aldus to create a positive.  It looked better than the print that the film developers gave me.   -- ',1

1007,' The compressed image format used for the Voyager disks is not (yet) supported by any Macintosh display software that I know of. However, there does exist a program that can convert the images to a format that is recognized by recent versions of both Pixel Pusher and NIH/Image. It is called PDS Decompress and is available via anonymous ftp from the pub directory on delcano.mit.edu [18.75.0.80]. This is a Binhex/ Stuffit archive and contains the application itself, Think-C source, and a very brief description.

1008,' Sorry, Fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, I must disagree.  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since those did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today, it is precisely the Khomeini\'s of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world Muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the Qur\'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how Islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence.  When I consider such possibilities, it is with not inconsiderable fear.',0
