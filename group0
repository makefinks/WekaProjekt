Text: I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate respond to the Charley Challenges (and judging from my e-mail there appear to be quite a few of you.)    It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles include within it something similar to the following:      Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.  Really I\m not looking to humiliate anyone here I just want some honest answers.  You wouldn\t think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout Christian would you?    Nevermind

Text:  There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both atheists AND theists.  I\m sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at genocide.  Perhaps since I\m a bit weak on history somone here would like to give a list of wars caused/led by theists?  I can think of a few (Hitler claimed to be a Christian for example) but a more complete list would probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement is.   On a side note

Text:  If you force me to do something am I morally responsible for it?   Well make up your mind.    Is it to be instinctive not to murder or not?   It\s not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill one another.   Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.  I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance. I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals such as primates have the beginnings of a moral sense

Text: My turn to jump in! :)   I think you mean circular not recursive but that is semantics. Recursiveness has no problems it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights is a complete lie and deception as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free it is always purchased at some cost  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another or even a group of others whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable the serial killer or the victim?  According to that beautiful line those two rights should be completely inviolate that is noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people\s life and/or liberty but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence it is.   Oooh I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see) in a coma etc.  Also under current law accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is he who has the gold makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?   If you mean the golden rule as I stated yes almost every system as implemented has used that in reality.  Sorry I don\t deal as much in fiction as I do in reality.     WELCOME TO OZLAND!!!!!!! :)  What is NOT arbitrary?  If you can find some part of society some societal rules morals etc. that are not arbitrary please tell me.  I don\t think there are any.  Sounds like euphemisms to me.  The difference seems to be that objective is some reasoning that I like

Text:      From what I read the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together over the phone.  The bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a (I assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains I would expect.    I read this in an article in The Australian Muslim Times the newspaper (weekly) of the Australian Muslim community.    If this is true perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if they see this posting) can elaborate.       I don\t deny this fact.  The thrust of my argument here is that   (a) Salameh is according to US law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important  distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim.  In general anyone who calls themselves a Muslim and does not do or  outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave Islam.  The term Muslim is to be contrasted with Mu\min which means true believer.  However whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu\min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God) whether I for example am a true believer or not.  For example I could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here without anyone knowing.  Thus when we say Muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress Islamic teachings.  By Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu\min

Text:  Hi Adda  Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately like all works from this time period and earlier all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books scraps really that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books letters etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of Bibles which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50 then yes.   From the original authors.  We call them Matthew Mark Luke John Peter Paul James and one other not identified.   As long as you make it.   Regards

Text:  And that of course is the point.   You can\t simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity and have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour then someone\s suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible

Text: Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4                         Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example It is raining or Today is Tuesday.  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So God exists and There exists a God both express the same proposition.  An argument is to quote the Monty Python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on.  (The phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn\t seem obvious to you don\t be afraid to question it.  You can always say Oh yes you\re right it is obvious when you\ve heard the explanation.)  Next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore.  Finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments but are not.  For example:  If the Bible is accurate Jesus must either have been insane an evil liar  or the Son of God.  This is not an argument it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we\ll come to those later.)  Another example:  God created you; therefore do your duty to God.  The phrase do your duty to God is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form A because B.  If we\re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence the statement is an argument.  If we\re trying to establish the truth of B then it is not an argument it is an explanation.  For example:  There must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not  start. -- This is an argument.  My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here the conclusion is not true because the argument\s premises are false.  If the argument\s premises were true however the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a truth table for implication.  The symbol => denotes implication; A is the premise B the conclusion.  T and F represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right.  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: ... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man.  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing for example that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem; however it does not demonstrate that the witness\s testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent\s particular circumstances.  For example: It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you\re quite happy to wear leather shoes?  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent\s argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For  example:  Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You\re white.  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one alleges that one\s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well.  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance.  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.  Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.  In science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\t find me guilty; I\m suffering enough through being an orphan.  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.  The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example we can distinguish quite clearly between:  Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer  Hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian so you must dislike atheists.  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For  example:  I took an aspirin and prayed to God and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For  example:  The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services\ official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded  question:  Have you stopped beating your wife?  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination when they ask questions like:  Where did you hide the money you stole?  Similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue? or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example consider:  We should not speak ILL of our friends and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very  lightweight.  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: If we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we\ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.  A IS BASED ON B FALLACIES / IS A TYPE OF FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: Isn\t history based upon faith?  If so then isn\t the Bible also a form of history?  Islam is based on faith Christianity is based on faith so isn\t Islam a form of Christianity?  Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren\t dogs a form of cat?  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B B is true therefore A is true.  To understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false.  Again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form If A then B therefore if B then A.  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that\s the way it\s always been.  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone\s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations in an argument about a general rule

Text:  Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical and religious motives where religion is just one attribute that separates the groups from each other.  But I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example of a case where religion is not helping instead it is used as a weapon against other humans. And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side it looks like the Serbs are the oppressors willing to use even Christianity as a weapon against their former friends.  Cheers

Text:  This is a good point but I think average people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with American culture if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other) it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong TOO new or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak but as long as it doesn\t hurt anybody...    These are good quotes and I agree with both of them but let\s make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like ...let him be as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace. or something like that.  (Of course I suppose if someone were REALLY at peace there would be no need for inflicting evangelism)   Well it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time 5 of those 7 have converted always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan or sons of immigrants hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since I\ve been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put arguments on this usenet it never does any good.  Argumentation does not really seem to apply to Christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a step the person takes naturally almost instinctively...   best regards  ******************************************************************************** * Adam John Cooper\t\tVerily

Text: [why do babies get diseases etc.]   Here\s the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different. The Earth by latest estimates is about 4.6 billion years old and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200000 years. But the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact disease-ridden long before there were people. (Yes there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders of course but there are some.) Heck not just fossil evidence but what we\ve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least indirectly though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) \started off\ in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense. I\m really curious as to what you mean by \the degeneration of the genetic code\.    Umm. Nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing. For example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease I\m sure you\ll agree. But it still pops up from time to time even today... and doesn\t do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants \overgrazed\ (forgive the poor terminology I\m an engineer not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect right? And you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan who\s making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors. As far as I can see our immune systems imperfect though they may (presently?) be must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary? That is God made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here\s another puzzle. What exactly do you mean by \perfect\ in the phrase \created... perfect and without flaw\? To my mind a \perfect\ system would be incapable of degrading over time. A \perfect\ system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer\s glue? That is the original genetic \instructions\ were perfect but were \written\ in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point as I said was that there really isn\t any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least that I\m aware of.) But I couldn\t help making a few nitpicks here and there. :->  Sincerely

What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals.  This may not on the surface sound like a bad thing but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice this is not conducive to a free society.  Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly therefore a deterrant to future offenders. Mathew sees it most probably as a means of rehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you

Text:   How about this description: An object that is at one time both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle? I hold that no object satisfying this description could exist. The description is inconsistent and hence describes an object that could not exist.  Now suppose someone pointed to a bicycle and said That object is at one time both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle. This does not mean that the bicycle does not exist it measn that the description was incorrectly applied.    The atheist says The descriptions of God that I have been presented with are contradictory and hence describe something that cannot exist.  Now your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of It.  This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle and when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one are told that it is a Euclidean circle-square.

Text:     Define perfect then.       Take your foot out of your mouth I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but don\t make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

Text:   Ah now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario.   We will grant that a God exists and uses revelation to communicate with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your own words) \This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck makes him take dictation and then hides away for a few hundred years\.)  Now there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world (which is all this person has ever seen) but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.   Now based on this can this person be blamed for concluding absent a personal revelation of their own that there is almost certainly nothing to this \revelation\ thing?    Absent this better language and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?   Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.  Now if there does happen to be say a Christian God will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake?   Sincerely

Text:   I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read?  Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian scientists would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course) that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have died for a lie.  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way) but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the real thing.    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools or  illogical men their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don\t think his arguments warrant the use of a Therefore...   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony\s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone  who thinks the bible is total fiction that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b.       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).

Text:     No the argument says John has known Q ie a codified version of the logia and not the original assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses of course like that John might have known the original yet rather referred to Q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version in the first place.   The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well into the dating usually given for the gospels.       Not necessarily Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the version given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive for instance.   As far as I know the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a statistical analysis of the texts.       Yep but it will take another day or so to get the source. I hope your German is good enough. :-)       I still do not see how copies from 200 allow to change the dating of John.       Yes but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence. The authencity of many letters is still discussed. It looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them as well.

I will argue that your latter statement I believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith - that is if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that no gods exist (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don\t   know and therefore don\t believe in them and don\t NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position even  after reading the FAQs that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to faith and existence. I as a Christian maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist He is eternal. With this said I feel it\s rather pointless to debate the so called existence of God - and that is not what I\m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that god does not exist I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However in what follows I will use the phrase the existence of God in it\s \usual sense\ - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of God.   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one\s promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation I will have to ask what observtions are you refering to? There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean for example people whoes  partents believe in God also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the existence or non-existence of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say I believe that God   does/does not exist. Personally I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the existence of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes I use Him because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use She go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\ll be  glad to.)     And please if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it\s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I\ve misunderstood something in the FAQs or if they they think  I have not read them well enough

Text:  Well this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt.atheism where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system without resorting to accusing others of bigotry.  It\s somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race religion ethnic background sex or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I\ve seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus pending further evidence I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots

Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business) and instead of American Atheists we would have similar religious organizations.

Of course people would have to come up with more fascinating  rationalizations for their actions but that could be fun to watch...  It seems to me that for most people religion in America doesn\t matter that much.  You have extreemists on both ends but a large majority don\t make too much of an issue about it as long as you don\t.

Text:  Well I could use the argument that some here use about nature and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has and since you are a human any powers you have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence you cannot have superhuman powers.  Sound good to you?  Anyway to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group since you are posting from a american college site I\m willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And assuming there is some coherency in your position I will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves in some respects.   Yep.   Good.   Extra evidence?  Why don\t we start with evidence at all?  I cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would ever accept.  As for the second it is the foundation of the religion. Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period) is a believer and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since these are all ancients anyway one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else-- even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*

Text:  I\m not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because I\ve seen it drive - I\ve done more than at in fact - I\ve actually driven it. (now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what\s out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don\t believe it\s entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before but they exist. The pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  pink unicorns don\t exist because I haven\t seen them this conclusion has it\s foundation in observation and theory. A pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God however has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven\t defined God as existence - in fact I haven\t defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it\s relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I\m saying. I\m making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I\m not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have evidence or ... then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don\t follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn\t know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that God does not exist. Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \god is\ is meaningful at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I however am not doing this. I am arguing one and only one thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am as you would say a theist; however

Text:   Sorry you\re right.  I did not clearly state it.    The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s) and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption(s) contradict your assumption then I would say there\s a lack of consistency here.  Now I know you\ll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic?  But you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.   ;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?    It might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it\s still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had wrought.   First all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?  One of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don\t want this but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.  And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God. Can love as a truth be proven logically?    John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast in this way but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course I do know arrogant Christians doctors and teachers as well.  Technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant Jesus for instance.   I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective.

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is if there were no death penalty would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.

Text: [reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\Dwyer)]         From A Dictionary of Philosophy by Anthony Flew:   Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For instance \No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering\ might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it the contention remains true just as \5 + 7 = 12\ remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  \One ought always to do the right thing\ is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of \self-evident truths\ but can he deny the subjectivist\s claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is he suggests

I used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth etc.  Why do we spend so little time on the Mayan religion or the Native Americans?  Heck the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also what about the Egyptians.  I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept it as a _religion_ and not a mythology

Text:  The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn\t hit their targets (and we know they did) or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq\s military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don\t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science but with smart bombs it\s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That\s war the way it really is. But the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it\s one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago I know not what course others may take -- but as for me give me liberty or give me death!  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong eh?  I\m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in WW2 eh?  I guess we shouldn\t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe and you\d be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\t understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn\t have the military roll into Baghdad so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\s sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing but wiping Hussein off the map would\ve been better!  And as for poor poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one\s guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards

Text:    This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism i.e. the   belief that you can\t deny anything that you can\t prove doesn\t exist.  This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are  conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have  to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster we must believe  in objects or beings that haven\t been proved not to exist so why stop at  God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan  except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond  hair... and they all live  on other planets so we can\t see them)  The   reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians  have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.    How did they shoot themselves in the foot?     There is a big difference here Stalin didn\t say that he stood for a    particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism etc.) and   then did the opposite (like the religious movements) he was at least   an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this   viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because   one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the   russians that helped Stalin that weren\t atheists - don\t they contradict   your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant   to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists   can\t value life as much as theists (which you didn\t support).      Ah and here\s another point you didn\t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist  doesn\t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\t exist he/she may  just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\s the example:    Strong atheism - I believe god does not exist   a positive belief   Weak atheism   - I don\t believe in a god       a negative belief    these are NOT the same some one that has never thought of the idea of  god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that  you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\s look at it this way (in sets)    suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent  as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas  exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa then E(S)= no is the person  not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that  even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:    christian :  (AE(A)=yesBE(B)=no  . . . GE(G)=yes......) where G = god    atheist (strong) : (AE(A). . . . .GE(G)=no)    atheist (weak) : (A.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set    agnostic :  (A.......G E(G) = indeterminate E\ ....)      Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not   will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always    prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival   trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions

It doesn\t compare religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.

Text:  I am not aware of any Turkish Caliphate viewpoint on this. Can you reference?  However I found a quote due to Imam Ali whom the Shias follow:  Men never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever even those of everyday life. Indeed allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one\s wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.   We see them without religion when alone they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse men\s solicitations whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones.  (Quote from Mas\ud al-Qanawi ref. A. Bouhdiba Sexuality in Islam  p. 118).  I wouldn\t consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM) viewpoint though.  For all we know

Then with a particular goal in mind you sould be able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance with the general goal.   In an objective system there are known goals.  Then actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals or not.  Simple.  The problem with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is the goals of each society are different.  Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.   I\ve said it many many times.   Which part do you have a problem with?   But we can enslave the animals right?  But just not kill them?  Or are you a vegetarian for health reasons?   No.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant anyway.   Of course not.  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species for food.  It might be nice though if the other animals were not made to suffer.  For instance a cow in a field lives out its life just about the same way it would in the wild.  They seem happy enough.  However the veal youngsters aren\t treated very well.   I don\t know.  What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no inherent system.   Nope.  Again

Text: ##I strongly suggest that you look up a book called THE BIBLE THE QURAN AND ##SCIENCE by Maurice Baucaille a French surgeon.  It is not comprehensive ##but it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it ##for you through interlibrary loan. ##    I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)  ##In short Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre- ##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that ##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by- ##gone days.  So he read what he could find in Hebrew Greek Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn\t go away they got worse. ##Then he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So he picked up the Holy Qur\an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems but not as many.  SO he applied the same logoic as he had ##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he ##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur\an but ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So he ##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to ##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after ##all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by ##pour standards a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that ##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur\an had to ##say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the ##Holy Qur\an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in ##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known ##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur\an (assuming he had authored ##it)?   ##      So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from science.

Text:   (Deletion)   Yes sorry. I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun but I must have met the minority then. And given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob I am not intimate with Jewish theology but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god an no-no for Christians the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive and it is foul play IMO to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary.. Further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can\t becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can\t it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way

To cover my arse what I\m trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly no argument for the existence of god (generic as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight) which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I\m a little fuzzy on the edges though

I don\t claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn\t harmful although it isn\t helpful either (to the mating process).

Similarly a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting in Britain they would be committing a crime.  But they are not they are broadcasting from Denmark so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it in spite of the apparent law-breaking.  Of course I\m not a lawyer so I could be wrong.  More confusingly

Text: frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\Dwyer) writes ...  While I\ll agree that these are generally held to be good things I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally good or bad.  And when I referred to the truth I was using the term hypothetically realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some higher authority (aka absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one\s morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another be it morals or consequences people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society trimming down the population

The discussion (on my part at least) began with Benedikt\s questioning of the historical acuuracy of the NT. I was making the point that if the same standards are used to validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history then virtually nothing is known of the first century.  You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection has nothing to do with history

Text: [reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]         For many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word on faith we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing rather than as some agnostic posters would have it whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence

Text:   You misrepresent me Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book Orientalism by Edward Said.  Edward Said by the way is a Christian not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read Orientalism by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact I may post some of it here (if it isn\t too long).   I haven\t read Lewis\s article so I can\t comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics as I understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again read Orientalism by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view Selim -- I think rather it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women I have made posting after posting on this subject showing that Islam is not anti-woman etc.  However have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one under the title Islam and Women reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur\an and contains numerous Qur\anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\an and hadiths.  Now just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam even if it is opposed by the Qur\an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur\an prohibits drinking.  Now if a person says I am a Muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist etc. etc.  Selim I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is for example anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well Selim your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur\an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow in your theory it is by following the Qur\an that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think Selim you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim if I remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues

It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were inserted (badly) by later editors.  As for the four gospels being in harmony on the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.   Acts 1:18: Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of  iniquity; and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his  bowels gushed out.  Matt. 27:5-7: And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple  and departed and went and hanged himself.  And the chief priests...bought  with them the potter\s field.   Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34  Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30   MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the  word  that  Jesus  said unto him Before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon he wept.  MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear  saying  I  know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus  which  said unto him Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly.  LUK 22:60  And Peter said Man I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately while he yet spake the cock crew. LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.  JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?  Verily  verily I say unto thee The cock shall not crow still thou hast denied me thrice.  JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.   (This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made!  Not the only time he does this either...)  MAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet  saying  And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of Israel did value;  zechariah 11:11-13 (nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)  What was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?  scarlet - Matthew 27:28  purple John 19:2   Mark says the third hour or 9 a.m. but John says the sixth hour (noon) was when the sentence was passed.   Matthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews Mark\t --  The King of the Jews Luke\t --  This is the king of the Jews John\t --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews   vinegar - Matthew 27:34  wine with myrrh - Mark 15:23   Matthew said many stood far off including Mary Magdaline Mary the mother of James and the mother of Zebedee\s children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far off and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less. John says that Jesus\s mother stood at the cross along with her sister and Mary Magdalene.   Matt.27:4650: And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice  saying Eli eli lama sabachthani? that is to say My God my God why hast thou forsaken me?  ...Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded u the ghost.  Luke23:46: And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said Father unto  thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus he gave up the ghost.  John19:30: When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said It is  finished: and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.   Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem appearing to many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints.  John is the only one who mentions Jesus\s side being peirced.   Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.  Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and Mark 10:34 has after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again. As far as I can see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the post-resurrection narratives have on the third day.   Matthew says Sunday at dawn Mark says the sun was rising and John says it was dark.   MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath as it began to  dawn  toward the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past Mary Magdalene and Mary the  mother  of  James and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him.  JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early when  it  was  yet  dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.   MAT 28:2  And behold there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it. MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning  and  his  raiment white as snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake  and  became as dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women  Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified.  MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre they saw a  young  man sitting  on  the right side clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.  LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments:  JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting the one at  the head  and  the  other  at  the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.   Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes this claim.   Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon and met Jesus there.  This was his only appearance except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples.  Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe.  Later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.  Luke says two followers went the same day that Jesus rose from the dead to Emmaus a village eight miles from Jeruselem and there Jesus jioned them but was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening they finally recognised Jesus whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem they told the disciples of their experience and suddenly Jesus appeared among them frightening them as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them.  John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in Jeruselem where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them but Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce more Jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not recognised.  After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat Jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat together and converse.  The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus contradicting Matthew Mark Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of God: And when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight.  And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood by them in white apparel: Which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven? This same Jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven Acts 1:3-11  Paul outdoes every other authority by saying that Jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.   Matthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.  John says nothing about it.  Acts contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)   MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled.  MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you that this generation shall  not pass till all these things be done.  LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you This generation shall not  pass away till all be fulfilled.  1 thessalonians 4:15-18  1 Corinthians 15:5 (12) Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12) Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection) MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  \tAnd Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. (2 Kings 2:11)  \tNo man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven \t... the Son of Man. (John 3:13)  As you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right!  (In fact I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth. (Due to the nature of the story

Text:    When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking behaving communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews Mushriqin Christians etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs assumptions etc to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those such as History Conflict etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism because when there is a community that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions say Nation or Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity or parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government however  they individually insist they do not have gods from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition atheism does not exist.  We are a atheist society in fact means we reject the din other than ours.   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned from a Quranic point of looking at things

Text: This kind of argument cries for a comment...     : >>...God did not create : >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns. : >  : >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is : >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of : >>creationism vs evolutionism God created the original genetic code : >>perfect and without flaw.  : >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~  Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldn\t we?  Perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted. Moreover intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this.  Try Watson\s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish & Baltimore\s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?) and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect : but that doesn\t mean it\s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we\ve thought - for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays gamma : rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I\d replace created with formed since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years and earliest signs of life (not true fossils but organic stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I\m sorry I can\t give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration?   I can understand Scott\s reaction:  : > Excuse me but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!   :  : In response to your last statement no and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you don\t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one\s own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\t make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade. I haven\t seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John\s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\s fault? (the original : question) -- I say no it is not.  Of course nothing evil is god\s fault.  But your explanation does not work it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\t know that : Satan is not responsible and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don\t think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you\ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are meant (presumably by God) to be : punished by getting diseases.  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God as people have done since the beginning then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh I admit it\s not perfect (yet).  But I\m working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\t explain : the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a why behind? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics although I\m sure I\d find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I\m sorry but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

Does an : agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space?  Do you : understand English? :  : Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  They will do their best : to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or : run away.  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes?  People : who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or : cause them (or themselves) violence. :   Isn\t that what I said ... What are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.  : [...] :  : |> It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function : |> (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs : |> when the members of one generation pass along their traits to : |> subsequent generations. Homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. If I : |> take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to : |> intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our : |> species at least is going nowhere. : |>  :  : So *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children? : Hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.

Consider the context I\m talking about an evolutionary function. One of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who don\t have no purpose in that context.  :  : |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to : |> survive the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must : |> exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a : |> family.

Also the parent from single : parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must : by your arguement die.  By your argument homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context means. I am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process. :  : |> But it gets worse.

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly : without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill : and pre-condom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children. : These days is just ain\t true!  People can decide whether or not to have  : children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\s sex &c (but that\s  : another arguement...) so it\s more of a lifestyle decision.  Again by : your arguement since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must : be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are  : as unnatural as each other.  Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental. That homosexuals don\t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.  :  : |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some : |> policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that : |> their sexuality is a preference a life-style an orientation a : |> choice that should be protected by law. Now if homosexuality is a mere : |> choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social then it : |> is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they : |> became prominent.  : |>  :  : People are people are people.  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live : their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so fancy a date?  Here\s pretty obvious dodge do you really think you\ve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not telling anyone anything I am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality (providing it\s a merely an alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard. :  : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to : |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of : |> the homosexual life-style.

All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the : bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by : a bastard to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either : accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.  I\m sure your comment pertains to something but you\ve disguised it so well I can\t see what. Where did I mention ideals out-dated or otherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything at all to contribute?  :  : |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in : |> scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from : |> teaching; by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and : |> biological.

Text:     The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John but not in the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke\s text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly.       When they are from about 200 why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what\s that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies. Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.     In other words

Text:  True.  At first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn\t have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\s like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was nice and clean (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs) but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!   [ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]                             ^^^^^^^^^  I should have said here militarily justified.  It seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified. I apologize.   I have often wondered about this.  I\ve always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan\s island fortress of Truk.  A good inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\ve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes I have heard that we found evidence (after the war BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\s ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate IMO.   I don\t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the  circumstances which make those decisions necessary and I regret the suffering caused by those decisions.    [...]   Actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country we probably wouldn\t intervene.  Not that we don\t care but we can\t be the world\s policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion) then we still wouldn\t have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\s oil  interests caused us to take action.   [...]  I\m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective.  Well in a sense yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to.   They suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much? The world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect.  Many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable but that\s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.  [...]  Probably because we\re not the saviors of the world.  We can\t police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or some other places.  Tell me how we could stop them and I\ll support it.  I for one do not agree with the present US policy of sucking up to them as you put it. I agree that it is deplorable.   Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.)  I\m not an expert on California law or even US law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize the system but let\s not have unfounded allegations of racial  prejudice thrown around.   No not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.   Germans perhaps.  Peers doesn\t mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers.  It means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent\s motivation(s).   OK granted.  However you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.  The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)  BTW I never used the word conspiracy.  I don\t accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.   Hardly.  I didn\t say that it\s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately we don\t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\t say it is OK -- it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary.   I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I\m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\s say) we now know.  That doesn\t mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\t see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don\t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don\t!  I just don\t condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.   You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. I as an absolutist am in a position to judge but I defer judgment.   Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision.  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that and I am prepared to do so.  I don\t believe that you can make the same claim.   And BTW the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being  so deplorable.  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn\t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes bunk.  The US lost 230000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But  we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of  *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with  the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!   What hogwash.  If hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died  it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people not due to  the Allied bombing.  Regards

Text: Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians by Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi  I think it\d help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.  When was the last time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don\t actually know; these aren\t rhetorical questions.)  How \bout some Supreme court justices?    One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news program on a local station...The promo said something like Who are these cults and why do they prey on the young?  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF BAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn\t preying on the young I don\t know what is...  I used to be (ack barf) a Catholic and was even confirmed...Shortly thereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom who really insisted that I continue to go to church felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up as a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I\ve heard in my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest and she agreed.  The priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn\t believe it there was no good in forcing it on me.  Actually I guess he wasn\t amazingly cool about it--His response is what you\d hope for (indeed expect) from a human being.  I s\pose I just _didn\t_ expect it...    I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet I can also see its usefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you\re just going to be worm food in a few decades and that there isn\t some cosmic purpose to humanity and the universe can be pretty difficult for some people.  Having a readily-available pre-digested solution to this is pretty attractive if you\re either a) gullible enough b) willing to suspend your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind

Text:   : There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread : that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.  This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations.   It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent and neither is science. However science has one advantage theology doesn\t: it is self- correcting with nature as its judge.   It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self- consistent simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer a bunch of separate branches it is one. From particle physics to psychology. And no aspect of our life or our universe is safe from its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.   There is no need : for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by : physics chemistry biology etc.; everything is random nothing is : determnined.  Actually determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have any meaning as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective. Bill can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not?   : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence it\s just a happy accident.  Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of  numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same principle - only the systems that can start replicating will survive those which don\t don\t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)  : For an atheist no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought -about- : an event can have value.   From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively from my perspective. Nature does not have values because it does not have a perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if I think about what it would it be like in their position I will eventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution. Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity too.   Bill have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.) for starters.  : How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It : seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what : in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to : establish your values.  C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is severely flawed.  Some values such as the Golden Rule can have a rational basis. Some others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well. Indeed as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools they also became better at killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against one\s own people.  The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people together under one god. Their god did not care much about people of other nations.   At the time of the NT things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_ and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality and along with it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)  : Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what : difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does religious or : otherwise there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only : way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\t like it : - that\s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any absolute sense.  It looks like you haven\t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may  value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result of some physical event) and other\s happiness too if the observer comes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their meaning.   It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view. This includes gods too their values are only _their_  personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths do not exist.   The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others\ existence.  Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps dolphins and many other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed.   : That you don\t like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or God\s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your : objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\ve been : conditioned; there is no truth content. The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality.  The last statement does not logically follow. In fact there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one.  You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective point of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view _which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not cease to be subjective.   From a non-observers non-point of view values do not exist. Neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love. Such things are  inherently subjective.   Once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if we don\t I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought. If god gave us morality to judge but I disagree with him it is not my fault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\s own and then to get mad at this.   God must be schizophrenic.  : All of this being so you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil : etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever.  Neither can the opinion of any god for that matter. I cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.  Bill take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being _including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view

The long and short of the story is that 75000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn\t swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice peaceful solution.)  \Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn\t reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man\s history.@  Atheists on the other hand (preenpreen) are typically not an ideological social caste nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.  Well

I consider your argument as useful as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True and utterly useless.  (Note this is *any* belief not belief in Gods)  #>Gullibility #>blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more #>reliable indicators.

The point is #there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism.  No some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\t implied by what you say before because you\re trying to sneak in innate features of [all] theism.  The word you\re groping for is some.  #Gullibility by the way is one of them.  No shit Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make?  #And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw #men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.  I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\s because it\s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us  split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls.  #>|>(2)  Define irrational belief.  e.g. is it rational to believe that #>|>     reason is always useful? #>|> #>| #>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. The latter has #>|been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate.

Which is it? #> #That\s bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of #usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed.  O.K. it\s oval.  It\s still begging the question however.  And though that certainly is allowed it\s not rational.  And you claiming to be rational and all.  At the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before [we didn\t hear a _refutation_ before so we\re back.   Deal with it] : you can\t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone who thinks reason is crap won\t buy it you see.  #Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics #and mathematics are therfore circular.  Anybody else think Godel was silly?  #>The first part of the second statement contains no information because #>you don\t say what the beliefs are.  If the beliefs are strong theism #>and/or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true.  The #>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an #>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is #>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is #>used to obtain it. #> #  #I\ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions #of god here. #  #An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here #is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the #axiom of choice. And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems #out of which they are usually derived. I exist is derived if you want #it that way. # #Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms. #  #what is it you are trying to say?  That at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable  for no particular reason at all.  Example: I am not dreaming.  #>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of #>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational. #> #>I can\t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To #>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which #>I suspect you do not have. #> #  #Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal supernatural entities #with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or #the way the world works.  IMO any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists for example.  #>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe #>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However the beliefs say they are #>|more than a work hypothesis. #> #>I don\t understand this.  Can you formalise your argument? #  #Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make #B true it is at best a work hypothesis. However the content of B is that #it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating #evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed) #says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further #contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed this can #have interesting effects.  Peculiar definition of interesting but sure.  Now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\t my  catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example?   Maybe they  don\t believe in it.  Maybe it\s the conjunction of B asserts B and jail/kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF but he wrote about people truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels the following are of some relevance:  Galactic Pot-Healer A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished ironic and amusing novel.  A Maze of Death Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  VALIS The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  The Divine Invasion God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  The Handmaid\s Tale A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it right again.  The book is the diary of a woman\s life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women\s right to own property is revoked and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood\s writing style is difficult to get used to at first but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  The Bible This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However it is probably worth reading if only so that you\ll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions so make sure you get the one true version.

A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area.  Argues both for negative atheism (i.e. the non-belief in the existence of god(s)) and also for positive atheism (the belief in the non-existence of god(s)).  Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne. 541 pages.

ISBN 0-87722-767-5  JAMES TURNER  Without God Without Creed The Johns Hopkins University Press Baltimore  MD USA Subtitled The Origins of Unbelief in America.  Examines the way in which unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900 and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American and particularly New England developments.  Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism Without God Without Creed is rather the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea the belief that God exists.  316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4  GEORGE SELDES (Editor)  The great thoughts Ballantine Books New York USA A dictionary of quotations of a different kind concentrating on statements and writings which explicitly or implicitly present the person\s philosophy and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff\s What Great Men Think of Religion and Noyes\ Views of Religion. 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  The Existence of God (Revised Edition) Clarendon Paperbacks Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism (1977) and was concluded with Faith and Reason (1981).  In this work Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in Mackie\s The Miracle of Theism.  In the revised edition of The Existence of God Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  The Miracle of Theism Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as replacements for God such as Lelie\s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin\s works and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

Text:   Diplomatic :-)  I realize I\m fighting Occam\s razor in this argument so I\ll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary.   Firstly I\m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not at working out the method itself.  As a specific example I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type the hard ones.) To do these with any efficiency you need to figure out a variety of tricks. Now I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_ and program them into the computer. You can of course \obfuscate\ the trick and write the program so that it is uncovered but as far as I can see the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material much of which isn\t used.  One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation but (again as far as I can see) this still has an air of \if you see object X then perform action Y\ and we don\t seem to get anywhere. The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see and what conclusions to draw from it\s experience.  The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are side-effects but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\s code?  The next problem is the sticky question of What is colour? (replace \colour\ with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably the materialist viewpoint is that it\s the product of some kind of chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so a computer won\t see colour because the chemistry is different. Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn\t? It shouldn\t because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do we see colour?    A bit of idle speculation...  If I remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called \Unitary Evolution\ (or \U\) is governed by Schroedinger\s equation and is well known. The second process called various things such as \collapse of the wavefunction\ or \state vector reduction\ (or \R\) and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a \measurement\ takes place although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs. When it does occur the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction.  I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \something else\ which I shall imaginitively call \part X.\ It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R although that something might be the wavefunction itself (in which case part X is simply the wavefunction. Note though that we\d need more than U to explain R.)  Anyway I\m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to be some link between consciousness and R in that we never see linear superpositions of anything although there are alternative explainations for this. I\ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X but since this is only speculation that won\t matter too much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics.  I\ll go back to my nice padded cell now

(I might be a little off on the title but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  ->\tThe book says that Jesus was either a liar or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths Mithra comes to mind.  ->\tSome reasons why he wouldn\t be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn\t people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn\t mean that it isn\t true.  Liars can be very pursuasive just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don\t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\t that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  ->\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool logical people see  ->this right away. ->\tTherefore since he wasn\t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri quad etc) that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\t one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  ->\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don\t have my Bible with me at this moment next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\t be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.

Text:  The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements since the is in those statements is the is of predication rather than of identity.  Instead they should be translated using a predicate letter.  Using g to designate God and j to designate Jesus and the predicate letter E for the property of being eternal the first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej.     The second premise appears to contain an is of identity in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that Jesus is a subset of God suggests that strict identity is not desired here. If however the first premise means that all members making up the set God have the property of being eternal

Text:      Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically physiologically and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book Brainsex by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.   Now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT.  Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree) and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book Brainsex.  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that  women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.   There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet\s widow Aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.   You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam etc. but I recently reposted something here under the heading Islam and Women -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted from soc.religion.islam so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title was though).  I will email it to you if you like.    Your statement that other religions are no different is I think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.   Aisha who I mentioned earlier was not only an Islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader.   The Prophet\s first wife who died just before the Hijra (the Prophet\s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.  Lucio

If so then it\s  all in the mind of the beholder according to the relativist and hardly  compelling.  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or  solipsist argument and that we have this perfectly good alternate set of categories (subject object event) [which can be reduced to (subject object quality) without any logical difficulty] and why yes I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of  the beholder.  #>>If not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?

This & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics therefore: to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as the ones above and those such as How can u trust science science was invented by man! only goes to further show the weakness of their religion.  In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing xtains never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.

Text:   This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.   The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran\s version of the Old Testament stories and seems on the face of it to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However it was plain to me that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood for example the bible is full of detail (forty days and forty nights pair of every animal etc.) we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran\s description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage.  Yes no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.  The above is of course

People die for lies all the time.    Was Hitler a liar? How about Napoleon Mussolini Ronald Reagan? We spend millions of dollars a year trying to find techniques to detect lying? So the answer is no they wouldn\t be able to tell if he was a liar if he only lied about some things.   Why do you think he healed people because the Bible says so? But if God doesn\t exist (the other possibility) then the Bible is not divinely inspired and one can\t use it as a piece of evidence as it was written by unbiased observers.   Were Hitler or Mussolini lunatics? How about Genghis Khan Jim Jones... there are thousands of examples through history of people being drawn to lunatics.   So we obviously cannot rule out liar or lunatic not to mention all the other possibilities not given in this triad.   Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in order to fulfil these prophecies) possibly selective diting on behalf of those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such riddles (like Nostradamus) that anything that happens can be twisted to fit the words of raving fictional \prophecy\.

A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find but I think I may take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty  vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have.

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians Creation Science on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran

Text:       I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur\an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur\an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur\an is not particularly imprecise in wording though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However

Roger and I have clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue; specifically that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of the Scout Oath (specifically the promise to live morally straight).  There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because it\s like comparing apples to oranges (i.e. people can\t control their race but they can control their behavior).  What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue?

Text:   : I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of : the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group : of the population.   I\ve been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of people at least in Finland seem to be apatheists - even though 90 \% of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland religious people are actually a minority.   Could it be possible that many people believe in god just in case? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal\s Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn\t care - it believes but doesn\t know what or how.   People don\t usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say that they are not born in the Spirit but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.   I\m afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people nevertheless -  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to. Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too many people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow (and unconsciously hope god wouldn\t notice ;-) )  : Also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the : other qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie how it : expresses its own selfishness.  If logic and reason are valued then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I\ve yet to see good reasons to believe in gods or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.  However why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics works? Strong deep structuralists like Atkins have proposed that perhaps after all

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It\s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\s a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble) but is stronger.  For example some people are vegetarian though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn\t help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is we are.  But if society is those who make the rules that\s a different question.  If society is who should make the rules that\s yet another.  I don\t claim to have the answers either but I don\t think we do it very well in Ireland and I like some things about the US system at least in principle.  # #>#2)How do they define what is acceptable? # #>Depends. #On....  Again this comes from a certain question (see above).  Well ideally they don\t but if they must they should do it by consensus IMO. # #>#3)How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position? # #>By adopting a default position that people\s moral decisions #>are none of society\s business # #So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?  Because sometimes that\s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when it is and equally importantly when it isn\t.  # and only interfering when it\s truly #>necessary. # #Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?  IMO it isn\t often that interference (i.e. jail and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it\s a sort of liar\s paradox: force is necessary for freedom.   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\t object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\t arise if we don\t actively wish to take way anyone\s freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a justice system.  How can we even define that term?  Only by consensus I guess.  #  Thus you #>get a situation where The law often allows what honour forbids which I\ve #>come to believe is as it should be.   # #I admit I don\t understand that statement.  What I mean is that while thus-and-such may be legal thus-and-such may also be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it but you don\t let yourself do it.  Eating meat

Text:   Are we talking about me or the majority of the people that support it? Anyway I think that revenge or fairness is why most people are in favor of the punishment.  If a murderer is going to be punished people that think that he should get what he deserves.  Most people wouldn\t think it would be fair for the murderer to live while his victim died.   Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic but your views are in the minority.   Where are we required to have compassion forgiveness and sympathy?  If someone wrongs me I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone kills another then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn. Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?  Or are you stating that human life is sacred somehow and that it should never be violated?  This would sound like some sort of religious view.    Once a criminal has committed a murder his desires are irrelevant.  And you still have not answered my question.  If you are concerned about the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why isn\t this same concern shared with imprisonment.  Shouldn\t we by your logic administer as minimum as punishment as possible

Text: Is it just me or has this part gotten beyond useful?  Gregg is not as I understand his posts giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie\s life.  If that\s correct end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don\t accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I\m picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain more or less a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn\t say in agreement) with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind it not possible under secular law (legally as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can and often does believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy the requirements of the secular authorities are by definition congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).  Regards

Text:     It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille\s translations (in his book The Bible the Qur\an and Science) for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   ...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.  (Also note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator\s interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic which is why it is included in brackets.)    You\re right what the verses _do_ contain isn\t all that remarkable.  However Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon that\s how he\s a Dr.) thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.

Text:   Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real story (that is a bigger headline).  Let\s back up to 1935.  At this point we have the Masoretic text the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic etc.) and the Septuagint the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first it includes additional texts and second in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to fixing/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that to the best of my knowledge these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material but as far as I know there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint where the latter isn\t obviously in error.  Again though the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material but so far this hasn\t happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT

I\ll post a couple of these a day   unless group concensus demands that I stop or I run out of good   material.    I haven\t been particularly careful in the past about saving   attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson   but someone correct me if I\m wrong.  This is probably the longest   of my entire collection.  ________________________________________________________                                     So that the                                   Prophecy be                                    Fulfilled                                       * * *         In considering the Christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see Matthew\s main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages often not even about the promised Messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:         We begin of course at the beginning.         (Mt 1.21-22):  [Mary] will bear a son and you        Joseph will name him \Jesus\ (which means G\d is        salvation) for he will save his people from their        sins.  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet:         [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE)        king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah) but could not        quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz        and his court in Judah) were told of this ...its        heart and the heart of its people shook...   And the        lord G\d said to Isaiah go to meet with Ahaz...         ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah        naturally) saying Ask a sign of G\d your lord.  It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.  But        Ahaz said I won\t ask; I will not put the lord to a        test.  Then (Isaiah) said Hear then O house of        David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men that        you must weary my god too?  Therefore the lord        himself will give you a sign:  Behold a young woman        is with child and will bear a son and name him        Immanuel which means G\d is with us.   He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good.  For before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics.  Further he the Hebrew word almah (young woman) as specifically virgin.  But this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus while thought of by later Christians to be G\d walking among men was never called by the name Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:         After Jesus\s birth in Bethlehem Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king Herod.         [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of        Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:        Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.   What the lord really said was this.         [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child I loved him.         And out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called        them (my people) the more they went from me; they        kept sacrificing to the Ba\als and kept burning        incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\s oracle.  But it was indeed Israel that once called out of Egypt wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G\d.   Again this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:          While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes         [Mt 2.17-18]   By this that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:         A voice was heard in Ramah wailing and loud        lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;        she refused to be consoled because they were        no more.     The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15 referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel Ephraim and Manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no more.  It is metaphorical of course since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.        It is interesting to note that it was Leah not Rachel who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her children it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to Ephrath (Bethlehem).        As for Herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time.  Herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus\s life to enhance the message of the church\s gospel.        Because of the whole story\s similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\d comforts the weeping Rachel saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course this would not suit Matthew\s purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again the prophecy Matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:         We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth          [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled He shall be called a Nazarene.  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second we have to ask who He is.  There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges an angel tells Samson\s mother that she will         [Judges 13.5]  ...conceive and bear a son.  No razor        shall tough his head for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines.  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus or the messiah of G\d.  But it is the best that can be found.  Obviously Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:         Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.         [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases.  As expected the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have         [Is 53.4]  Surely he [the suffering servant] has        borne our sickness and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel Jehovah\s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised yet cherished Israel as the instrument of the nations\ salvation by G\d.       The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a servant going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So while someone might want to say that figuratively Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that Matthew\s parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:        Upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldn\t arouse the attention of the local rulers.         [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah.            Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved        with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on        him and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He        will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his        name.  The Isaiah passage quoted reads         [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold my        chosen in whom my soul delights.  I have put my        spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the        nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice or        make it heard in the street.  He will not break a        bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick.  He will        faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail        (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has        established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands        await his law.  You see Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly.  But the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G\d there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of G\d.  Also the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic ...the coastlands await his law. to the Christologic the Gentiles will hope in his name.   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name.  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus one has only to read the whole chapter Isaiah 42 and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and plundered...   So we see that when Matthew\s attempt at prophecy is examined it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:        Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.         [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went each was 24 hours long lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a day was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays instead of Sundays.  (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\t forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus when days and nights are referred to together 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus Jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.        As the good book tells us Jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is 3pm Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then Jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew\s little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his god\s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:       Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better.  Matthew says         [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says          You will indeed hear but never understand; and you        will indeed see but never perceive.  Because this        people\s heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of        hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them her with their ears and        understand with their heart and turn for me to heal        them.  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE when Israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of Assyria.  Isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from G\d calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.         [Is 6.9-13]  And G\d said Go and say to this        people `Hear and hear but do not understand; see and        see but do not perceive.\   Make the heart of this        people fat make their ears heavy and shut their        eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear        with their ears and understand with their hearts and        turn and be healed.  Then Isaiah said How long        lord?  And he said Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant and houses without men and the        land is utterly desolate and the G\ds take men far        away and forsaken places are many in the land.  And        though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned        again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled. The holy seed is its        stump.  Here we see that it is really G\d who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet\s warnings but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon\s (and David\s) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G\d to use Israel as a servant a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25 48.20 49.3)      We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah\s verse to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didn\t understand Jesus\s stories.  And as we see Isaiah\s verses are not prophecies but rather commands from G\d to him in the present.   Once again Matthew\s prophecy falls flat on its face.        Matthew tries again to make Jesus\s parables look like they have the prophetic approval.         [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a        parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world.  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the Psalms.         [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will        utter dark sayings of old things that we all have        heard and known things that our fathers have told us.         We will not hide them from their children but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord...  As was pointed out the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew\s gospel even inserted Isaiah\s name as this prophet.  Apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up.      Perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden.  Further they speak of things known that our fathers have told us.  Jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world.  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion.  This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again Matthew\s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew\s prophecies aren\t the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:         In Mt. 17.14-21 we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic.  But Jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didn\t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course you will find no one these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman\s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.         And the gods including Jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet life goes on.         Tales of mystics stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days Jehovah too.  But now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don\t get to see God anymore.         We\re too lazy; we\re not zealous enough; we\re        sinful; it\s just his plan; we put too many of our        own demands on G\d\s appearance; if we had the right        faith if we  were willing to meet G\d on his terms...       Yet even the most pious of men have not seen G\d.  You dear reader have not seen G\d.  Not literally you know that to be true. (I know that\s presumptuous and bold.  But searching your heart you know what I mean.)  All that we\ve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G\d.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G\d.  Sometimes they say See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G\d.   Thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning G\d into the everyday sights.   But that is not seeing G\d as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G\d the way people used to see.         What we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.  Jesus Rides on an Ass:         Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.           [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet saying         Tell the daughter of Zion Behold your king is        coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a        ass-colt.  Of course the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.         Lo your king comes to you; he is triumphant and        victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass-        colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn\t all that much difference here except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\s version we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has bungled.  Now excluding many respectable Christians I have met I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays...         Then entering the Jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done         [Mt 21.16]  Haven\t you read?  `Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things AND since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit Matthew\s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew Haven\t you read? for the source reads         [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord how majestic is        your name in the whole world!   You whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to G\d not his messiah king and not Jesus.  As mentioned it seems to be just one more case of Matthew\s pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to  my lord...:        Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110         The LORD said to my Lord sit at my right hand until        I put your enemies under your feet.  Taken at face value Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course the Christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It\s tempting to believe this if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation.  But there are problems.        In Jesus\s time the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\s rule.  Of course the Jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\s time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiah\s advent was imminent and who interpreted Psalms 110 among others as being messianic. What is the problem then?  Psalm 110 literally reads         YHVH\s utterance to my lord: \tSit at my right hand until I make your enemies your        footstool.         YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule        in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains.           You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever.  The word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But in the Hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G\d.  It is merely an address of respect.         There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of David or a psalm about David.  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about David\s covenant and endorsement from G\d.  If the psalm had been written by David it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king descended from David was not present in David\s age.  We have extensive tales of David\s doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah.      Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead in times of the exile when G\d had put his show of favour for David\s kingdom on hold.        The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G\d a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.       We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone though.  Here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still this event is common to the other gospels too.  So we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note though how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd.  Matthew has the Pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity be the target of Jesus\s question.  As we might expect Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus Had it Together All Along...:         We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John\s gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus\s career as told by even Matthew.  But for the moment we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G\d.  When constructing the history of Abraham Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king David the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom.         [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father Abraham        rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham but Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah or anything Christian.  I have tried and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John\s little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter\s Field:        We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes         [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple [Judas] departed... But the chief        priests taking the silver said It isn\t lawful for        us to put it in the treasury since it is blood        money.  So they... bought a potter\s field with it to        bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah         And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel and they gave them for the potter\s        field as the lord directed me.  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.         [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages        thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me Cast        them to the treasury --the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH.  First of all the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of G\d.  The deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G\d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word treasury had been replaced by the King James Scholars with to the potter precisely because this made Matthew\s quote fit better.  But this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah\s context whereas potter\s field is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However given Matthew\s track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty.       Of course Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\s situation and if as most Christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course to the average Thursday-Night Bible student the prophecy as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those Matthew\s work is convincing enough.  Wine Vinegar & Casting Lots:        Then Jesus is led away to be crucified.         [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink        mingled with gall; but when he tasted it he would not        drink it.  And when they had crucified him they        divided his garments among them by casting lots: that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet         They parted my garments among them and upon my        vesture did they cast lots.  First of all the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.         [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said I thirst.  A bowl of        vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he        had received the vinegar he said It is finished;  But Matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the Psalms.         [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity but there was none;        and for comforters but I found none.  They gave me        poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat) and        for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add        to them punishment upon punishment may they have no        acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living.  Of course the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in the psalm asks G\d for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the Jesus of the gospels says         [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said Father forgive them the        don\t know what they do!  Further Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\s drink not his meat as the psalm stipulates.         With the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask What of the casting of lots?  This brings up the 22nd Psalm which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus\s clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus\s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:        This psalm is attributed to David as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.         Verse 1-2:  My god my god! why have you forsaken me?!         Why are you so far from helping me far from the words        of my groaning?  Oh my god I cry by day but you        don\t answer and by night but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross.  This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus rather than king David.  Of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers.  Indeed Jesus doesn\t do much groaning even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.         6-8:  But I am a worm and no man-- scorned by men...         All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag        their heads;  He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let        him deliver him... for he delights in him.  This seems to fit Jesus\s execution pretty well with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.         12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.         16-18:  Yea dogs are round about me a company of        evildoers encir-cle me they have pierced my hands and        feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my        garments among them and cast lost for my raiment.         19-21:  But you YHVH be not far away!  ...Deliver my        soul from the sword my life from the power of the        dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing and I\m sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is         16:  Yea dogs are round about me a company of        evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my        hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally like the lion (ka\ari) which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to ka\aru.   But to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the prophecy this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.         Apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm\s true subject king David.  As a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms.  This doesn\t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then facts aren\t bound by our religious beliefs.        Matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus\s life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the New Testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\s crucifixion.  John\s gospel recount written about 70 years after the fact tells us at Jesus\s execution         [Jn 19.3437]  But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear and out came blood and water...        these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...        The will look on him whom they\ve pierced.  Of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.         [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...        And on that day I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child.  John\s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew\s attempts.  Matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John\s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.   Reckoned with Transgressors:         After his arrest Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.         [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers        one on his right one on his left.  And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says         He was reckoned with the transgressors.  Here Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53 about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53 and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.         Mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him. [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us         [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed Aren\t you the messiah?! Save        yourself and us!  This certainly fits with Mark\s recount which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said Save yourself! and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on         But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying        Don\t you fear G\d since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation?  And we indeed justly so        for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.         But this man has done nothing wrong. And he said        Jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom.         And Jesus answered Verily I say to you today you        will be with me in paradise.  Now this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man apparently noble and of principle doesn\t seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course Luke\s recount also disagrees with Mark\s.   Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G\d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen.  The End of the World--        Mt. 24:         Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.         The disciples: Tell us when will this [the temple\s        destruction] be and what will be the sign of your        coming and of the close of the age?         Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray for        many will come in my name saying I am the christ.          ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for        this must take place but the end is not yet.   For        nation will rise against nation... all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs.              They will deliver you up... put you to death        and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.        ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a        testimony to the nations and then the end will come.              So when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel ...let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains.               Immediately after the tribulation of those days        the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from        heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn        and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out        his angels... and gather his elect...              Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know        that summer is near.  So also when you see all these        things you will know that He is near at the very        gate.  Truly I say to you this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place...              But of the day and hour no one knows; not the        angels not the Son but only the Father... Therefore        you also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect.  From this it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn\t know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error.  But unfortunately Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away.       There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away... really means this race of people will not pass away...  Of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples.  It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek he didn\t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World.  The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles\ responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7 1 Peter 4.7 1 John 2.18 and Rev. 22.20 that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.         For 2000 years Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2000 years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that He is coming soon.  Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring?          So shortly after his crucifixion Jesus of Nazareth (Joshua-ben-Joseph) died.   It is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes anyway.  As has been seen there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen though that this matter is quite shaky.  But throughout Church history Christians have held fast to faith in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2000 years the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time.  Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution

They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife Jocelyne Parent 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife cutting her throat police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic battles.       Last year in Quebec alone 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited]   Then to say that women are somehow better or should be the one to stay home and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family often  more than men in many cultures throughout history. Seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child

If most people }use scissors to cut paper shouldn\t Consumer\s Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That\s possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was enlightened for its times. To (attempt to) extend the analogy this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never even heard of paper.  I\m not arguing that the Bible is disgusting though some of the history depicted in it is by modern standards.  However history is full of similar abuses and I don\t think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand I don\t know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting

How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If you want to be religious aren\t there more plausable books out there? Seriously the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent unlike the last one they invented.        For people who say Jesus was the son of god didn\t god say not to EVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn\t god say not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don\t you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?  Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn\t he write anything? Anyone know?        I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot.

[this was in response to the claim that Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed with the disclaimer (fiction I know but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and false statements]   I had not seen that claim or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book which I have raised in the past in the ISLAM: a clearer view thread as well as the root of the Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW] thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before if you want to defend your position then produce evidence and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course my statement was not directly aimed at you but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book indicating that they haven\t read it and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger who subsequently admitted that he hadn\t in fact read the book vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the a clearer view posting which I have challenged (not interpretation but statements of fact for instance Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores) and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation but you\ll have to support your end by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at but you have upheld the view that TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims.  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie\s essays which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course

Text:  That\s okay:  it\s what all the rest of them who come on here say...   This isn\t the guy who was a lawyer was he?  Could you give more info on this guy (never mind- I\m sure there will be PLENTY of responses to this post and it will appear there)   This is true.  Make sure it is true for ALL cases.     Why not both?  ;)    Why not die for a lie?  If you were poverty stricken and alunatic sounds perfecetly reasoable to me.  As to whether the societal dregs he had for followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not not necessarily. Even if he died for what he believed in this still makes him completely selfish.

Text:   Well I\ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder.  However who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this.  In fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again the blame is on society.   Yes but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay so this is what you call murder.  But the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances?   But this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And every member of society shares this blame.  And most people\s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information) we can\t always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn\t objectively perfect.  You see it doesn\t matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely. And you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don\t think our country has an objective system but I think such an objective system can exist in theory.  Without omniscience

Text: Archive-name: atheism/faq Alt-atheism-archive-name: faq Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.1                      Alt.Atheism Frequently-Asked Questions  This file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in alt.atheism.  Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the Introduction to Atheism; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn\t covered by the answer given please feel free to make your point.  Overview of contents:     What is the purpose of this newsgroup?    Hitler was an atheist!    The Bible proves it    Pascal\s Wager    What is Occam\s Razor?    Why it\s good to believe in Jesus    Why I know that God exists    Einstein and God does not play dice    Everyone worships something    Why there must be a causeless cause    The universe is so complex it must have been designed    Independent evidence that the Bible is true    Godel\s Incompleteness Theorem    George Bush on atheism and patriotism    I know where hell is!    Biblical contradictions wanted    The USA is a Christian nation    The USA is not a Christian nation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Subject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?  Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?   What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one\s   family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or \stay in the closet\ * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don\t  want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure  from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:     The folkish-minded man in particular has the sacred duty each in    his own denomination of making _people_stop_just_talking_    superficially_of_God\s_will_and_actually_fulfill_God\s_will_and_    not_let_God\s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]     For God\s will gave men their form their essence and their    abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the    Lord\s creation the divine will.  Therefore let every man be    active each in his own denomination if you please and let every    man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who    in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his    religious community and tries to butt into the other.     [...]     Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will    of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew_I_am_    fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]            -- Adolf Hitler from Mein Kampf trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It\s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed  to believe in God.  We certainly can\t conclude that he\s an atheist  though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus any claimed \truth\ in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\t to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage \means\ one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal\s Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing -- but if you don\t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal\s Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X he may end up in religion Y\s version of hell.  Secondly the statement that If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true.  Suppose you\re believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that  the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least that they are of  comparable likelihood.  If in fact the possibility of there being a God  is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on  evidence with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or  cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking the argument consists of four statements:    1. One does not know whether God exists.   2. Not believing in God is bad for one\s eternal soul if God does      exist.   3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.   4. Therefore it is in one\s interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information at no cost.  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to If you are a Christian it is in your interests to believe in God -- a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal\s wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam\s Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam\s Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\s  Razor.  In its original form it said Do not multiply entities  unnecessarily.  That is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam\s Razor they generally express it  more generally for example as Take the simplest solution.  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations  for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and  there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be  of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts Occam\s Razor might suggest  that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn\t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.   We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people  find unacceptable.   ------------------------------  Subject: Why it\s good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs visited by the ghost of Elvis and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and God does not play dice  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\re cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that God does not play dice [with the universe].  This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\s refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore Einstein\s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: I believe in Spinoza\s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in Science Philosophy and Religion A Symposium published by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life Inc. New York 1941.  In    The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events    the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side    of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him    neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an    independent cause of natural events.  To be sure the doctrine of a    personal God interfering with natural events could never be    *refuted* [italics his] in the real sense by science for this    doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific    knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.     But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives    of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine    which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark    will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm    to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good teachers    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal    God that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past    placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they    will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable    of cultivating the Good the True and the Beautiful in humanity    itself.  This is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably    more worthy task...     It was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions    a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a    personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.    If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the    unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our    science can reveal it.  The latter quote is from Albert Einstein: The Human Side edited by Helen  Dukas and Banesh Hoffman and published by Princeton University Press.   Also from the same book:    I do not believe in immortality of the individual and I consider ethics    to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind     it.  Of course the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does  not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something whether it\s money power or God.  Response:  If that is true everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\ reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member.  Further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don\t think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it can\t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some  external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of If a creator created the universe what created the creator? but with the addition of spiralling  improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is (or was).  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking in his book A Brief History of Time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy in the so-called  Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the  watch the universe is intricate and complex; so the argument goes the  universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above  those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly a watchmaker creates  watches from pre-existing materials whereas God is claimed to have  created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are  clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in  the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear  reactor we wouldn\t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument  would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a  different part of creation.  Finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that  the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore  stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the  argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not  random but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus  internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus\s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\ It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel\s Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel\s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel\s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal  system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary  arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be  valid or invalid (\true\ or \false\) within that formal system.  (Technically speaking the system must also be recursive; that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal  system.)  Essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a Liar  Paradox.  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is This  sentence is false.  Note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal  system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that Godel\s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom.  This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel\s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore it certainly wouldn\t tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel\s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:   RS: What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?   GB: I guess I\m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in       God is important to me.   RS: Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of       Americans who are atheists?   GB: No I don\t know that atheists should be considered as citizens       nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under       God.   RS: Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation       of state and church?   GB: Yes I support the separation of church and state.  I\m just not       very high on atheists.  UPI reported on May 8 1989 that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27 1989.  It can also be found in Free Enquiry magazine Fall 1988 issue Volume 8 Number 4 page 16.  On October 29 1988 Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane cochairman of the Bush-Quayle \88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as one nation under God (Bush\s phrase).  The following conversation took place:    RS: American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.       Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?    EM: It\s bullshit.    RS: What is bullshit?    EM: Everything that American Atheists does Rob is bullshit.    RS: Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush       campaign is on this issue.   EM: You\re welcome.  After Bush\s election American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989 C. Boyden Gray Counsel to the President replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by    As you are aware the President is a religious man who neither supports    atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or    supported by the government.  For further information contact American Atheist Veterans at the American Atheist Press\s Cameron Road address.  ------------------------------  Subject: I know where hell is!  Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called Hell in various countries around the world including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of alt.atheism are now  getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:   American Atheist Press publish an atheist\s handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn\t the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.    What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?    In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the    ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen    upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been    the guardians of the liberties of the people.

Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154 Treaty Series 358):     Article 11     As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense    founded on the Christian Religion -- as it has in itself no character of    enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of Musselmen -- and as    the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility    against any Mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no    pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption    of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans\ Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949 vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow Consul General at Algiers a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found

Text:  From _Free Inquiry_ Winter 83/84  the following is an introduction to the article Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz.   \tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of \tthe world\s fastest growing religions with as many as \t200000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\s \taggressive missionary program covering more than one \thundred countries it is spreading even to third world \tcountries. \t \tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and \tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict \tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president who allegedly \treceives revelations directly form God and a group of \ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief \tand practice the church is opposed to abortion \tpornography sexual freedom women\s rights and other in \tits view immoral influences of secular society and it \tforbids the use of tobacco alcohol coffee and tea. \t \tCentered in Salt Lake City the church is extremely wealthy \tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western \tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft \tBenson (former secretary of agriculture) the Osmond family \tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire and a score of high-placed \tgovernment officials. \t \tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by \tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had \tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill \tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he \thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of \tMormon_ the basis of Mormon belief.  This book written by \tthe commandment of God claims that the ancient Hebrews \tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors \tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who \thave been baptized in the true church will be reunited \tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can \tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the \thereafter.  Because of these beliefs Mormons have been \tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and \tas heretics by religious fundamentalists. \t \tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was \tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because \tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from \tPalmyra New York westward to Ohio and then to Illinois \twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham \tYoung who reportedly had as many as eighty wives took over \tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further \twestward to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City.  \tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of \tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice \tin nineteenth-century America. \t \tWhile other religions go back many centuries -- \tMuhammadanism 1200 years; Christianity 2000; and Judaism \t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are \tdifficult extensive historical investigation of Mormon \troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this \thistory objectively bu others maintain that such scrutiny \tis dangerous to the faith. \t \tIn the following pages _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles \tabout the Mormon church.  First George D. Smith a lifelong \tmember of the church provides a detailed critical \texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of \tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second we present a portion \tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin also a \tMormon since birth

You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it but by your definition it can\t be shown.  And morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However it seems silly to talk of a moral planet because it obeys the laws of phyics.  It is less silly to talk about animals

Text: (References: deleted to move this to a new thread)    To put it as simply as possible: *I am not a Muslim*.[...] I do not  accept the charge of apostacy because I have never in my adult life  affirmed any belief and what one has not affirmed one can not be  said to have apostasized from.  The Islam I know states clearly that  \there can be no coercion in matters of religion\.  The many Muslims  I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their  faith *purely by virtue of birth* and that a person who freely chose  not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death.     \t    \t    \t    \tSalman Rushdie In Good Faith 1990  God Satan Paradise and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth  year when I quite abruptly lost my faith.  [...]and afterwards to  prove my new-found atheism I bought myself a rather tasteless ham  sandwich and so partook for the first time of the forbidden flesh of  the swine.  No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down. [...] From that  day to this I have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person.     \t    \t    \t    \tSalman Rushdie In God We Trust 1985    Only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the nature of the novel could think such a thing.  I\ll accept it (reluctantly) from mobs in Pakistan but not from you.  What is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual Mohammad.  What\s worse the novel doesn\t present the Mahound/Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of Islam; in particular there is no lewd misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives.   Don\t hold back; he\s considered an apostate and a blasphemer. However it\s not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_ but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book.  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who has convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially claimed to have done so but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial Newsweek story might impart

Gillow noted geneticist has revealed  some unusual  data after working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   The Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur. reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report. Gillow who had  secretly  studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late 1950\s.  The  whole hat  thing that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn\t want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his skull. notes Gillow in his report. There are whole  laboratories in the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400\s is now scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats. Gillow is quick to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.  When it becomes time to replace the pope says Gillow

Text: [ . . .]  I am a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of right and wrong (or correct/incorrect or true/false) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is right (correct true veridical) or wrong (incorrect false illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\t be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the rightness of a moral position is a meaningless question) for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad better best) without asserting the correctness of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue

Text:    Yes I do.      My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it\s primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing   innocents is unconscionable.    At the very least the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn\t clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?

Text:  Yes this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However I believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari) can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini\s ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur\an hadith or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of fasad. This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis. But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned

Text:   Really>`?   No gravity is an inherent system.  You don\t need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone\s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis) but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective but not inherent.  Anyway as I noted before the practices related to mating rituals etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law.  Therefore some revisions are in order since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive or destructive etc. depending on the goal of the system (that is

Text:       I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I\ve articulated it above_ (which may not be the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam.  So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from  the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur\an.     In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.      Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur\an.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However please send any changes or corrections to the author and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can\t find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    Alt.Atheism FAQ:.  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don\t find anything in steps 1 or 2 your news system isn\t set up    correctly and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism and you\ll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don\t have FTP send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There\s other stuff too; interesting commands to try are help and    send atheism/index.  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you\ve tried the above methods and they\ve failed; it\s not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people\s mailboxes with requests for files.    it\s better than posting without reading the FAQ though!

Text:  What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by omnipotent that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive omnipotence must mean being all-powerful and not being able to do anything/everything.  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily omnipotent.  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively the US would be limited in what it could actually do although it had the power to do whatever it wanted. The US would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.  Regards

Text:  Secular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life Islam places the rights of society and every member in it above  the rights of the individual this is what I call true human rights.   As a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land I live in but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my  life. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must  leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.  In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don\t affect the genral population and don\t come into direct conflict with state  laws Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws on religion such as fighting in a Jihad giving Zakat (alms giving) etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.   After the Fatwa didn\t Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam

It is usually presented more in the form And *besides* I cannot see... ...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation.  Moreover it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not an argument in theism\s favor. Especially when different theisms offer  different explanations and even different adherents of what is purportedly the same theism give different explanations...    Not im my experience.

Text:  I\ve been following this train of talk and the question of dismissing atoms as   being in some sense not real leaves me uneasy.  It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects and therefore the   underlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in   this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it not the tree   itself.  The observation is indirect but no more so than observations I have   made of atoms.  Also what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done   with individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping   experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno   effect where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.  Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying   either.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid   technical background in the field.  What I read seemed a little confused a   quite a red herring.  Anyway if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think it   worked.  After doing so

Text:    # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don\t agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur\an the Bible etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven Hell and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic.       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing color to a person # who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book # FLATLAND (if you haven\t already) or THE DRAGON\S EGG.  The first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept...  [some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then # such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be # necessary.  The unseen is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But like all models a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean it\s okay to say      well Satan is just metaphorical but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further belief in God isn\t a bar to evil.  Let\s      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again we have a       case where someone does believe in God but by      religious standards they are evil.  If Bobby      does see this

For me it is a conclusion and I have no more faith in it than I have in the premises and the argument used.       No that\s a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually. When you use a different definition it is your thing but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist it is existence itself so I say it does not exist.   Interestingly there are those who say that existence exists is one of the indubitable statements possible.   Further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy.

Text:  [...]  Wait a minute Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we invaded Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times once this century but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where we cross someone\s border you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation invades the U.S. Virgin Islands would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico Panama).  [...]  No it\s someone who believes in peace-at-all-costs.  In other words a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and Czechoslakia but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews slavs and political  dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.  Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik you ask?  Well it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty peace over freedom then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if you\d rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant\s heel then yes it\s bad to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be bad and unconscionable.  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues especially those dealing with  the national defense.  But no they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and  many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)  All to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up  and defend our freedoms against tyrants and who realize that to do so requires a strong national defense.

Text:  (WEBSTER:  myth:  a traditional or legendary story...            ...a belief...whose truth is accepted uncritically.)  How does that qualify? Indeed it\s almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I\ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don\t meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah but not everyone knows that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you\ve read it you missed something so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible but your trusting it doesn\t make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows that\s clearly reason to doubt the Bible because not everyone knows your alleged god\s alleged existance.   1) No they don\t have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that\s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn\t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God on the other hand doesn\t generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids.  God doesn\t exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren\t.   No human reason hasn\t always come back to the existance of God; it has usually come back to the existance of god. In other words it doesn\t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god.  And in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn\t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in God only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and it\s reasonableness certainly doesn\t merit eminence. Divine justice...well it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second whether most atheists are correct or not YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are at the least

Text:   The above is probably not the most representative paragraph but I thought I\d hop on anyway...  What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer\s fall - which by the way I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text but my ex RCism may be showing - is that as Benedikt pointed out Lucifer had perfect nature yet he had the free will to choose evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan but how did Lucifer discover invent create call the action what you will something that God had not given origin to?  Also where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer\s free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation and in fact like salvation not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind salvation and free will are very tightly coupled but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still

If they were psychology would be a hard science   with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.      Your premise may well be right.  It is much more likely however   that it reflects your socialization and religious background as   well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to   pretend to have all the answers (and I don\t) I would say that the   xenophobia guilt and intolerance brought about by adherence to    fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing   the members of our society.

Whether you like it or not whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or not there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words.  It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs got that? You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support threatening the life of someone for words you are not yet civilized.  This is exactly where I and many of the people I know have to depart from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.  You or I or anyone are more than privledged to believe that someone whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him/her _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the miscreants or whatever short of physical force.

Text: Once again this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling between some software cracks...   [Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident and an  apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn\t actually  have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn\t matter to what  follows]  I don\t know whether I\m quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway back to current affairs   Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere it is a well known story a myth if you will known (according to Umar Khan) to Every Muslim school boy and girl and so presumably to Rushdie and to Gibreel Farishta.   Yes this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith and chose this myth to present it by placing the actor Gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took. Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened.  It\s somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the Arthurian mythos or the Grail legend or the Wandering Jew or dozens of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer consider Salman Rushdie\s children\s book Haroun and the Sea of Stories for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific storyteller -- works with existing story lines.   No.  Muhammad\s [Mahound\s] integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story and there\s no reason to think this was Rushdie\s intent: Gibreel as the archangel produces the verses (divine and satanic) though he doesn\t know their provenance.  It is not implied (in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:       *Not my voice* I\d never know such words I\m no classy speaker     never was never will be but this isn\t my voice it\s a Voice.       Mahound\s eyes open wide he\s seeing some kind of vision     staring at it oh that\s right Gibreel remembers me.  He\s     seeing me.  My lips moving being moved by.  What whom?  Don\t     know can\t say.  Nevertheless here they are coming out of my     mouth up my throat past my teeth: the Words.       Being God\s postman is no fun yaar.       Butbutbut: God isn\t in this picture.       God knows whose postman I\ve been.  It\s ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan? Or something else?  The answer is not given.  To be sure the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion among other things.  Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation but this novel proposes no answers at least not directly.  The very existence of a newsgroup named alt.atheism raises the same questions more forcefully and does propose some answers which is the real relevance.  If Rushdie\s mild fictional exploration is filth and lies and he asked for what he got are we next on the fatwa list?  (That\s a rhetorical question of course.) --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support Inc. Matthews NC These are my opinions.  For a nominal fee

God is said to require certain behavior but the only compulsion is the believer\s sense of duty. A standard of conduct does exist but we are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever ways we find convenient but our response to God\s edicts can in no way be used to question God\s existence. The behavior of believers is a completely separate question from that of God\s existence; there is nothing contradictory here.  To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist is really asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you can really say is that something is poorly defined but that in itself is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).

Text:  IMO the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidates your  assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.  Gullibility  blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more  reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing.  Now *some* brands of theism and more precisely *some* theists do tend to fanaticism I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?   Well there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational.  Which is it?  The first part of the second statement contains no information because you don\t say what the beliefs are.  If the beliefs are strong theism  and/or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true.  The second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis

My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that just that it is plausible.

You want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of WW2 when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary?

I think you\re being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I understand it that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people.   Oh come on.  With wars like the Falklands fresh in people\s minds that sort of propaganda isn\t going to fool anyone.   Yes?  And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered?

Text:   I disagree.  In the end the *individual* is responsible for his/her own irrationality.  The individual\s belief in some dogmatic religion is a  symptom of that irrationality.   Atheists and agnostics I would imagine but yes that was my point.  An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion as a Christian and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore the conflict between one\s religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may be non-religious was a secondary point.    As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.  Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma: skepticism.  Unfortunately it is not foolproof.  There is that  wonderful little creature known as the theory.  Many of us believe in the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this  theory is true so why do we believe it?  Because it makes more  sense than...?  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.    Well not ALL current beliefs are deficient but basically I agree.    Ideally this is true.  In reality though you have to acknowledge that scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some scientists assume a particular theory is true refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof  for the theory.  Remember cold fusion?    Not really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ($7500000 I believe) especially considering the outcome. My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was in Guyana incidentally although we footed the bill for the clean-up) and the U.S. has far more important issues to address.

Text: John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:   * The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *  *  treated as a matter of faith. -- Francis Hitching                     *    I have a few points to make about the above posting.      1. Science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either     real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning evidence and (if possible)     experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive     confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike     (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to     follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests     that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they     are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course you may not actually be a     creationist and this may not be your real intent.      2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his     statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the     quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.     Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context     and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate     scientists.  Of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may     not be your real intent.      3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of     evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one     line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that     disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate     claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck     proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond     of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course you may not     actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.      4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science an attack     on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on     science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the     fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long     ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and     irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course you may not actually be a     creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.   Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:   * Neither I nor Webster\s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *    I like Hitchings am not to be found in Webster\s B^).  Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (The Neck of the Giraffe).  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution (the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a non sequitur (i.e. the conclusion does not follow). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]    Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was titled `Giraffe\ sticks scientific neck out too far.  Excerpts include :    Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.  He goes after Darwin like Mark   Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and   pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.  He suggests   a mystical `organizing principle\ of life

Text: Another article that fell between the cracks:   As evidence for the Resurrection it is often claimed that the Disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.  Now I skimmed Acts and such and I found a reference to this happening to Stephen but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven\t found any...  Briefly no.  There is widespread folklore but no good documentary evidence or even solid rumor concerning the deaths of the Apostles. Further the usual context of such arguments as you observe is No Martyrs for a Lie: i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don\t even know how or where they died we certainly don\t have this information.  (By the way even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers to die for their belief be it in Jesus or Jim Jones is well-documented

I do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is making the same points and I\m pushed for time then I try to respond what I  believe are the strongest formulations of those points.  If that doesn\t include your post tough; this is USENET and life is tough all over.  #>(c) Since there\s a great deal of responses this isn\t always feasible;  I #>    do my best to honestly answer questions put to me. #  #You drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others. You appear #with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning #again.  I\ve only debated this issue twice in a.a and occasionally in t.a.  The first was in response to Simon Clippingdale\s positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative.  It doesn\t.   Now Simon has dropped out of the debate for some time; I take that to mean that he is either busy or bored with the topic.  I certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty.  Do you?   #>(d) I can\t always understand what you say #  #Neither can\t I understand you all the time. Usually one asks what the other #side means.  Usually one does.  Usually you\re clear but sometimes you aren\t  and I ask you what you mean; other times you seem to get extremely uptight  and I feel that I\m debating against line noise.  Sometimes I get tired and  sometimes I have other things I\d rather do.  Again this is USENET and life is tough all over.  You\re going to have to deal with it.  #>(e) You\re starting to get personally insulting; I may not even put your name #>    in the hat in future. # #That\s supposed to be a threat?  No that\s a simple statement and an assertion that I am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults.  For example those who accuse me  of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that I don\t answer their questions.    #>#Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there. #>#If only everything would be so easy. #> #>What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there. #>Because to all intents and purposes it *is* there. #> #We had that argument. For one your claim that everyone senses it #is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often. #And then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it #is there unless evidence against it has been found.  I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too: essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\s a good point and I\m thinking about it. #  #Your trick is to say I feel A is not right and so do many I know #therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process. In other words refutes it. You make the ontological #claim you have to prove it.  Nonsense.  My trick is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so  does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore  that A really is better than B subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.  Now get this:  really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model. It may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  trick to wit:  I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask.  However if even one person disagrees that A is better than B or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B then it is the case that B is better than A for that person and nothing more can be said.    I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that  a supermajority\s carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorist\s - which would of course be true but a no-no for an ethical relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion.  #>#For a similar argument I sense morality is subjective it does not #>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by #>#others. #> #>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively #>wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this #>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence #>against objectivism (except sometimes in a pragmatic sense). #> #It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to #judgements is absolute. And as long as you don\t provide evidence for #that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to #believe your hypothesis.  I\ve done this: freedom with the proviso that I still have to  answer jon\s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning.  #Further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective #you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes #above look quite misleading.  Not really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently of humans?  You\ll be hard pressed to find any that isn\t logically equivalent when applied to values.  #>An analogous set of premises would be: #> #>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest #>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance #>            of the estate and down the Malahide road. #> #>Premise 2:  I checked it out and found that the shortest route from my #>            which is much closer. #> #>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my #>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim #>using premises which are logically no different. #> #  #No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the #shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here. #And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a #shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it #is the shortest way indeed. In other words  your analogy works only when #one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not it is #a fallacy.  And if this were an argument for objectivism you\d be right.  It isn\t though it\s a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument *against* objectivism nor argument *for* relativism.  Your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values aren\t real and to use this to prove that values aren\t real.  In other words

Text: Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\an. In Islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However when an apostate makes attacks upon God and His Messenger the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition treason spying etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\s case.  There is a distinction in the Qur\an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions) creates disorder makes mischiefetc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc.) and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation  the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many Muslims and Rushdie\s (and his publishers) Media games.     I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Qur\anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Qur\an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex real-life situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple this or that process. There may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\an. The Qur\an asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements as taught by the Prophet(S.A.) in a hadith:  ...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one and does not know the circumstances  of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the Qur\an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the all-inclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur\an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\an.....  Based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many Qur\anic verses (Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them so that they may beware. (9:122)) a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. I\ve listed a few major  divisions below - there are of course many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\an Sunnah Consensus Reasoning)  The study of Qur\an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world. The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves? He (S.A.) replied: By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that fear for your religion and shun them. I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as The fortress of Islam. My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Qur\an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur\an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is apostasy) was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. Secondly Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him.   I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup. Unfortunately I do not have any access to email

Text: I am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.    First of all I\ve tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways with varying amounts of detail; it\s possible to give  succinct answers to most everything but there\s enough here to keep most of  you typing for hours I\m sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean  it) is great but it\s also important for me to have as broad a base of  individuals as possible so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it\s a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.    Secondly I hope some of the questions don\t come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like What would convince you of the existence of God imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact I\m not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself so my use of God is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it\s easier  than just repeating a deity or higher power every time.    Also I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system although I know some of you might contend that you don\t have ANY beliefs but are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases  required to get the precise idea across.    Lastly thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can in as much detail as you can and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.    ---------------  Where would you place your beliefs on the spectrum  \tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?   Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.     In what if any religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe  in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume  that the answer to this is yes; if you\ve always been an atheist or at least never a theist you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)   How serious was your/your family\s involvement?    How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?    How and when did your final break with your beliefs if any occur?  I  realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se; whatever the case just describe it in whatever detail you wish.     What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your conversion to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion through independent means or by some combination of the two or other means?     Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God etc) or was it perhaps at least  in part through other means (alienation from mainstream religion etc)?     To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you  feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where are they lacking as  an explanatory method?    What would it take for you to question or change your beliefs?  What would convince you of the existence of God what would convince you of the  plausibility of God\s existence and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time?    Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new secular religion and that scientists are in a very real sense the new priesthood.  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base or even a religious element?)    ---------------  This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have me on the basis of this survey write you to find out more about you and your beliefs?  If not fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.    ---------------  Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I\m doing with this data

Text:    Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_ not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end I found I had been following a mass delusion a lie. I can\t believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.   I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one\s belief critically.  I\ll tell you something I left out of my \testimony\ I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works thank god just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion.   I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger or what other people told me but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.  As a student of chemistry I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student\s workload considerably. Besides I had to do it twice since I failed in my first attempt. However I think I\ll never forget the lesson:   No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is inconsistent.  But it can still be wrong.   I found out that I was after all using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance suspension of fear  filtering of information. In other words it was only me no god playing any part.    Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts says my Bible.  Jesus may have lived and died but he was probably misunderstood.   This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith I will go by the evidence.   It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did considering the vast amount of evidence presented.   A liar how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible again.   I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered as heroes at least among those who believe. Dan do you think I\m lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I can\t go on lying to myself.  Blind trust is dangerous and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me she\ll know what to do. I\m willing. I just don\t know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence

I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying\ You fools do you still think that just believing is enough?\  Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by God according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith. But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to him (i.e. doesn\t know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesn\t make any attempt to live by the bible.  Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do) as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being \spat-out\  Can anyone help me this really bothers me.--   in Christ

Text:  \tAs I don\t know this book I will use your heresay.   \tIt depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified that is where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them.  \tSome religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable and especially subserviant in a basic way to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.   \tReconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers

Iraq he suggested was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands while the community of nations won every day -- with no taking of life or loss of life.  -- FCNL Washington Newsletter.

Or that a successful interception of a Scud was defined as the Patriot and Scud passed each other in the same area of the sky?  And of the 7\% that was the smart stuff 35\% hit. Again - try to follow me here - that means 65\% of this smart arsenal missed.   Prove it.

California is spending more than $90 million annually on capital cases and until this year hadn\t executed anyone since 1972.  Texas the national leader in the number of executions spends an estimated $2.3 million per execution.  That compares to an average cost of incarceration in Washington state of $25

Text:  Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer there has to be an interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person\s self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mental/verbal level and don\t usually find expression in society except in an impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.   Also what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society in a very real sense?  To use the obvious example there is a political society and a racial society and a gender society and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue...    Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it doesn\t hurt others?  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it is not a morality in that it doesn\t propound any specifically preferred behaviours.   I\ll add a hearty me two.  However one could just as well say just because certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn\t really get an impression of which one is truly right.     best regards

Text:  [...stuff deleted...]  As many posters have said in as many posts lately this is just not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the  _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render  that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say that you don\t believe something than it is to say that you don\t have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to  think about.  It\s not either or.  Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind.    I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable but not necessarily applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning but there is overwhelming reason every single day day in and day out

Text: marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu (Kevin Marshall) <1r2eba$hsq@csugrad.cs.vt.edu>  Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone which by its nature is without justification.  That is what I mean by the word ``faith\\: belief without justification or belief with arbitrary justification or with emotional (irrational) justification.  For example when someone says that God exists that they don\t know why they believe God exists they can just feel it that\s faith.  Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information or increased mental faculty.  Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion I can live with that.  Science is not a religion because there is no faith nor dogma.  Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher is not an atheist s/he tends to be called a theologian.  A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is a special set of beliefs sanctioned by God himself and therefore to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways\\ is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed. Sure interpretations of what ``God said\\ are changed to satisfy the needs of society but when God says something that\s it.  It was said and that\s that.  Since God said it it is unflawed even if the interpretations are flawed.  Science (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast has a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma. A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time AND *AND* ****AND*** a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available.  That\s the only rational thing to do.  That\s good philosophy.  Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion views its beliefs as being perfect and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them.  It\s easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn\t require a good rational justification of the killing.  I don\t consider ``he\s Jewish\\ or ``he was born of Jewish parents\\

Text: With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity I thought the following quotes by Mr. James Holly the Anti-Masonic Flag Carrier would amuse you all...       The following passages are exact quotes from The Southern  Baptist Convention and Freemasonry by James L. Holly M.D. President of Mission and Ministry To Men Inc. 550 N 10th St. Beaumont TX  77706.         The inside cover of the book states: Mission & Ministry to Men  Inc. hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of  this booklet with two provisions: one the material is not changed and two the source is identified. I have followed these provisions.          Freemasonry is one of the allies of the Devil Page iv.         The issue here is not moderate or conservative the issue is God and the Devil Page vi.         It is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public  school education in America were Freemasons Page 29.         Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His  disciples and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message. Page 30.         The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity  through fraternity liberty and equality is toleration. This is seen  in the writings of the \great\ writers of Freemasonry.

Text:  From a parallel thread.  Much about definitions of bombs etc. deleted. [...]   Mathew I agree.  This it seems is the crux of your whole position isn\t it?  That the US shouldn\t have supported Hussein and sold him arms to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein and it\s a done deal. Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say Well we sold him all those arms I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad for Kuwait.  No unfortunately sitting back and letting things be is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein\s military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with your statement Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to Hussein.  So it\s really not the Gulf War you abhor so much it was the U.S.\s and the West\s shortsightedness in selling arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable right?  If so then I agree.

Text: Kent Sandvik and Jon Livesey made essentially the same response so this time Kent\s article gets the reply:   This begs the question of whether it ever started-- perhaps because accuracy was always an intention.   It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away (reporters if you will).  As I said earlier the telephone metaphor is innately bad because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts.  (Also I would point out that by the standards generally asserted in this group the distinction between eyewitnesses and others is hollow since nobody can be shown to be an eyewitness or indeed even shown to be the author of the text.)  There is no evidence that the original texts of either the OT or the NT are largely lost over time in a sea of errors corrections additions and deletions.  In the case of the NT the evidence is strongly in the other direction: the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more than a low level of significance.  It is reasonable to assume a similar situation for the OT

That\s a convenient technique much seen on alt.atheism: define those who disagree with you according to a straw-man extreme that matches virtually nobody.   Very noble and patriotic.  I\m sure the fine young Americans who carpet-bombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon destroyed Iraq\s sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the sky or further or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their trenches [or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to] were just thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the defense of the liberty of ... well wealthy Kuwaitis.

Text:  As I understand that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed to sell oil or do many of the things under the initial sanctions but is still surviving.   Of the ~93\% (I have heard figures closer to 80\% but I won\t quibble your figures) most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie and we used them around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions.    2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70\%.  That figure came not from some fluke in the Pentagon but a someone working with such stuff in another part of DoD.  3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm is true around areas where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very little bombs in populated regions explaining the figures.     This figure is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it is indeed accurate then how do you explain the discrepancy between that figure and other figures from international organizations? Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70\% which is  still far higher than your 35\%.  Or does your figure say a bomb missed if the plane took off with it and the bomb never hit the target

When you say (paraphrased) #in (2) that this is not evidence for [benefactor] for example what you #mean is that it\s no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].  Yes that\s what I mean.  #In (3) however you\ve shifted the meaning of evidence for [benefactor] #so that it now means `absolute\ evidence for [benefactor] rather than #`relative\ evidence for [benefactor] w.r.t. [bug].  Not really I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions (prayer your \Rapture\ example) I don\t buy your use of Occam\s razor in all cases where A=0.  In my example one couldn\t dismiss [benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh.  I brought up the \one-by-one dismissal\ process to show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\re saying in this post it seems you agree and we\re talking at cross-purposes.  #(3) is still in contradiction to (1). # #Some sums may help. With B = benefactor b = bug d = dosh arrives in account: # #  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1 # #Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0 so it\s either the benefactor *or* a bug #which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then # #   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d) # #so # #   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1 # #but (3) implies that # #   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.  No this isn\t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5 with necessarily no new observation (we\ve already seen the dosh) to change those estimates.  I was trying to say (again in my clumsy way) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\s precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise  would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference not of science or statistics.    Alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer can\t be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).  #> As they do when the set M is filled by the universe is caused by x #> where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc.  - and no observation #> tends to one conclusion over the other. # #Exactly the point I was making I think. So we don\t throw out any of #these contrary to your assertion above that we do.  Some people do Simon and they think they are doing excellent science. My sole point was that they aren\t.  #>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x #>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite #>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the #>> hypotheses out. # #> Exactly my point though I may have been unclear. # #You said the diametric opposite which I guess is the source of my confusion.  I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.  #> What I\m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of #> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for #> all or perhaps any versions of theism - and it isn\t true that those for #> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor. # #On the contrary those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which #can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this #thread.  Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which means that you\re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i though we\ve already established that it\s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over all i.  #> Simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or #> non-existence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and #> at worst barking mad. # #Luckily I make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions. You wouldn\t be constructing a strawman here would you Frank? #Although that doesn\t of course rule out my being barking mad in any case #(I could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to Cleese et al). # #But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is #evidence against an hypothesis that doesn\t imply that observation of #the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis reducing the #estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity it\s still #evidence against H.  No I got that.  I\m talking about the case when A=0.  You\re clearly correct when A!=0.   And I\m not constructing a strawman (though it\s certainly possible that I\ve misunderstood what you\re saying).  However by any standards a system that says when A=0 gods are highly unlikely and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don\t exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience systems such as this (including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain a fallacy upon close examination.  If that\s not what you\re saying

Text:  I read it when it first came out and the controversy broke. Put my name on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really offensive none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher) and read it cover to cover (to use a phrase that seems popular here right now).  And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to but it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family and moved to England; I grew up in New Delhi) it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the yaar at the end of a sentence Butbutbut the occasional hindi phrase etc.)  At the time I still sorta-kinda thought of myself as a muslim and I couldn\t see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed\s wives and had not (as my grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed\s wives were prostitutes; in short every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely.  (And I won\t mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops I just did!)  Perhaps in a deep sense the book is insulting to Islam because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent? She can come directly to me can\t she? How do we know that Muhammed didn\t just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn\t screw up or put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book sight unseen on the say-so of some holy guy. Not to mention murder the author.)   I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really silly argument - after all how many of these same people have read Mein Kampf? It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don\t they just read the book and decide for themselves?  Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book and the absence of protest from the liberal muslims to Khomeini\s fatwa outrage

Text:  [ Deletia; in case anybody hadn\t noticed Frank and I are debating   objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics. ]         It may be that being a non-native English-speaker I\ve misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you don\t assert; my apologies. I\m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though.         Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity\s sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have.        I\m saying the Universe has a real age because I see evidence for it; cosmology astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of people\s opinions of it because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results.         I can\t see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it (s)he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same.         Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion. If those tests were just my opinion then their own tests (which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no? They don\t which I take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.         Map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain. You have a sharp point I\ll give you that; but you still haven\t given me a way to quantify morality.         We agree. Hypotheses however can change; I hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.         Better and worse are (almost?) always defined in the context of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct *within* *that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of good and bad; I wish you luck.         Isn\t that what _you\re_ doing when assuming an objectively real morality? Besides what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my statement?         Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim? Besides I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir \incorrect\ morality seems to function fine. How come?        As for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies; say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example (if such still exist).  [ deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]         One thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason.

Text:   I don\t think I\ve changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one.  I didn\t say what would be considered cruel only that a painless death wasn\t.  Now cruelty must involve some sort of suffering I believe.  I don\t think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain but it\s over so quickly...   Pardon?   No.  Well again I stated that a painless death isn\t cruel but I don\t think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain.   Anything more than an instant I guess.  Any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think (this includes the gas chamber and drawing and quartering).  I\d say that any pain that lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may be an arbitrary cutoff

Text:  [ ... my stuff deleted ... ]   Bill you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn\t.  This board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy to share posters\ experiences regarding atheism to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole to share resources relating to atheism and even to socialize with others with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come here to preach it is also used to argue the case for atheism.     If you want to accuse people of lying please do so directly.  The phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic.     The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers into good people and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American Friends Service Committee (Quaker) Catholic Relief Services Bread For The World Salvation Army soup kitchens and Mother Theresa spring to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names of some analagous Islamic groups?)    When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her Christianity I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread enough

Text:  Perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is.  If we can\t measure anything objectively then the answers we get from physics aren\t objective either.  That\s what I mean when I say there\s no objective physics.  Sure we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2 but that\s maths.  It\s only physics when you relate it to the real world and if we can\t do that objectively we\re stuck.  (Of course this displays my blatant bias towards applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations based on real world observations.)   It\s an axiom that it\s invariant.  But if the two of us measure it we\ll get different answers.  Yes we call that experimental error but it\s not really error in the conventional sense; in fact if you don\t get any that\s an error :-)  You could argue that the value of c is objective to within +/- <some value>.  But I\d call that a rather odd usage of the word objective and it opens the way for statements like Murder is objectively wrong for all people

Text:  Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so newspaper magazine articles interviews etc. supporting Rushdie there would appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman\s right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside it\s interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these  groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of  hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard  was annoying.)  Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at organized Islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular Islam - an Islam separated from it\s Qur\an it\s Prophet God its legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslim\s made their anger at his book known. The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was by this time already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals. The situation was a serious one with far-reaching political implications. At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.  Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as  this has no responsibility has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular heroic Knightmounted on the his media steed  doing battle with the dragon of Islamic fundamentalism.  Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who  grew up in a Muslim atmosphere knew well what Muslim\s hold dear  who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander insult and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continued his mischief instead of having the good sense to desist. Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdie\s continued media mischief even after this was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support government support was just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making was applied to Rushdie.   I have made no attempts at justification only at explanation. Image is the chief concern of Muslim \apologists\ for Islam and for Rushdie. If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture

People can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are saying that the universe has a _real_ age independent of my beliefs about it.  Why?  #      The age of the universe like most scientific facts can be #emirically verified through means that\ll give the same result no matter #who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the #largish side...).   This assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesn\t depend on what we think.

The same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value. If a moral system makes a prediction It will be better if... that can be tested and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction This drug will relieve pain...  #      People\s *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective; #you can have any idea you like and I can\t stop you. Universae and #their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are and if you #dislike some detail of them that\s a problem with your *opinion* of #them.   Sure.

No.  That\s because it\s an assumption.

Text:     This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur\an and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini being dead really can\t respond but another poster who supports Khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism.   So to answer your question the only way you can judge is by learning  more about Islam that is by reading the Qur\an and understanding it\s  basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see  who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at  odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve  muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles  of Islam

Text: Sorry about the delay in responding due to conference paper deadline panic.   [Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]   That (complicated) isn\t in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it\s more the other way around. It\s from    P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\)  where G\ is the complement of G  and by axiom P(anything) >= 0 so P(HG\) >= 0 so P(H) >= P(HG).  In a sense HG is necessarily more complicated than H for any H and G so I may be splitting hairs but what I\m trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is P(H) >= P(HG) holds with equality if and only if P(HG\) = 0.   Well P(x | A) = P(x | B) means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior probabilities P(A) and P(B):    P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>      P(A | x)  =  k P(A)   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)  where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).  So A and B are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesn\t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.  In the particular case where A = H and B = HG however we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG) although we don\t know the actual values and it\s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG.   That\s certainly true but the particular point here was whether or not a `divine component\ actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\.  Now it seems to me as I\ve said that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather *less* well if one proposes a `divine component\ in addition since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\t even equal to P(x | H) in this case but is smaller (H is memetic transmission G is `divine component\ x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.   Not that I\m a statistician as such either but:  The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the (read `my\) observations to date. However theism (of the type with which I am concerned) *also* suggests that for instance prayer may be answered people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways.  This means that these regions of the space of possible observations  which I loosely termed appearances of god/s have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.  Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on making appearances of god/s possible must come from somewhere else (i.e. other possible observations).  All else being equal this means that an observation which *isn\t* an appearance of god/s must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.  Sorry if that\s still a bit jargonesque but it\s rather difficult to put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total area under them is always unity.  An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is the coin is fair and that B is the coin is unfair (two-headed). (I\ve used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)  Then    P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1   P(T | A) = 0.5  }    P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1   P(T | B) = 0    }  The observations are a string of heads with no tails. This is compatible with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they don\t actually appear) must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads.  Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The observation x[n] at time n is another head x[n] = H. The estimates are modified according to                              P(H | A)   e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m                               P(H)  and                              P(H | B)   e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m                               P(H)  Now we don\t know P(H) the *actual* prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed.  Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have                   n   e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)  and                     n   e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B)  and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.  The loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism and between fair coin and theism with observations consistent with both. A tail which would falsify unfair coin is analogous to an appearance of god/s which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities just that the principle is the same.    Quite so but this type of theism is what I might call the G in the HG in terms of our Ockham\s Razor discussion and I\d bin it on those grounds.   The hypotheses don\t have to be falsifiable and indeed in my `model\ the theism isn\t falsifiable.    You don\t have to. We don\t need in the above analogy to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity. You don\t need to know the initial values of the running estimates either. It\s clear that after a large number of observations P(fair-coin) approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.  All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for observed x and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible under Ha and all else is equal.   Any observations you like; it really doesn\t matter nor affect the reasoning provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of god/s. Examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation.    OK we\ll downgrade *does* interact to *may* interact which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced.   I\ll explain but bear in mind that this isn\t central; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction Appearances of god/s will never happen as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn\t make this prediction either the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition.)  Predictions include such statements as Prayer is efficacious (implying If you do the stats you will find that Prayer is efficacious) or Prayer is *not* efficacious or Verily I say unto you This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled. I don\t think we have any problems of misunderstanding here.    That\s fine; I don\t claim that theism is false merely that the [finite number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is and that as I continue to observe the suggestion looks better and better.     I think you are; an appearance of god/s is sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.   No: by way of a counterexample let X = the coin is fair or more accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) the two sides of the coin are different. This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.     Oops. Sorry. Mea culpa.   We agree here.   The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992. Said Rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened although its failure to happen does not of course

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a \controversial\ nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet and Hints on writing style for Usenet are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.  If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above see the Finding Stuff section below.                                      Credits  These files could not have been written without the assistance of the many readers of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  In particular I\d like to thank the following people:  kck+@cs.cmu.edu (Karl Kluge) perry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry) NETOPRWA@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu (Wayne Aiken) chpetk@gdr.bath.ac.uk (Toby Kelsey) jkp@cs.HUT.FI (Jyrki Kuoppala) geoff.arnold@East.Sun.COM (Geoff Arnold) torkel@sics.se (Torkel Franzen) kmldorf@utdallas.edu (George Kimeldorf) roe2@quads.uchicago.edu (Greg Roelofs) arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee) madhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann) J5J@psuvm.psu.edu (John A.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However please send any changes or corrections to the author and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can\t find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    Alt.Atheism FAQ:.  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don\t find anything in steps 1 or 2 your news system isn\t set up    correctly and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism and you\ll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don\t have FTP send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There\s other stuff too; interesting commands to try are help and    send atheism/index.  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you\ve tried the above methods and they\ve failed; it\s not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people\s mailboxes with requests for files.    it\s better than posting without reading the FAQ though!  For instance

Text:     (deletion)     Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. The point is that theism is *a* factor.       That\s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say.       That\s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism.   Gullibility by the way is one of them.     And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.       That\s bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed.   Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular.       I\ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here.   An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice. And further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived. I exist is derived if you want it that way.   Further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.   what is it you are trying to say?       Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or the way the world works.       Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make B true it is at best a work hypothesis. However the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed) says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed

Furthermore you base this reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the absolute truth of your religion.

Text:  Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally (not) interested in God because without religious revelation there is _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and the theists/atheists are no different simply holding a different opinion on a matter of little practical importance.   Sorry but that doesn\t help. What test will you apply to decide whether it is God or Satan with whom you are speaking? How will you know that you have not simply gone insane or having delusions? You are like a loaded gun.   Ah

Text:  I don\t necessarily disagree with your assertion but I disagree with your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma). Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately you never  state why faith and dogma are dangerous.    If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in Waco you are missing the point.    The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet and therefore believed everything he said.  The problem wasn\t the religion it was the  followers.  They didn\t die because of faith and dogma they died because of their zealotry (or in the case of the children the zealotry of their parents).   So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their religion only?  What are you saying?  One\s belief in a Christian God does not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at but I\d rather hear you expand on the subject.    Again this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in God is a belief and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which of course may show unfair bias when studying say religion?      So Christianity is a prison eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this definition imply that one cannot change one\s mind.  In prison however you can\t just decide to leave.  One is voluntary the other is not.  The two are not compatible.    I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^) Seriously though some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn groups of people.  The common target is the infidel a curious being who is alternately an atheist a non-<insert specific religious affiliation here> a person of a different race or an Egyptian. 8^)  Please explain how just because thinking kills people.  (And please state more in your answer than Waco.)    I\ll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious  zealot with bad acne. 8^)  By the way

Text:   First you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as  capital punishment and abortion however vary greatly.    If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt I  presume) then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together.  As for the issues let\s start with abortion.  Personally I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact. However I support the right of any woman to have an abortion regardless of what my personal views may be because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That\s my opinion and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.  I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control but I  certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.    As for atheists believing all values are biological I have no idea what you\re talking about.  Finally

Text:   (Deletion)   It has. There is a guy running around in Switzerland who claims to have been conceived similarly. His mother says the same. His father is said to be a bit surprised.   But anyway there have been a lot of Messiahs and many have had a similar story about their birth. Or their death. A list of Messiahs could be quite interesting.       I would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing evidence for everyone to check. And the whole question is absurd.   Wouldn\t you feel bad if you\d find out that stones are sentient

Text:      Anton LaVey\s interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I read his Satanic Bible a few years ago for a social studies project as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called The Cult of Devil Worship in America.  The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self.    When I refer to Satanism I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I don\t consider LaVey\s church to be at all orthodox nor do I consider its followers satanists.  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche Crowley and Reich slapped in some religious doctrine added a little touch of P.T. Barnum and christened his creation the Church of Satan. No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.  At any rate it worked (for a while).  In its heyday the Church had a huge following including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis Jr. and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy by the  way.)    I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of Satan

Text:  I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are sufficiently sentient to have intentions.   In fact I have explicitly said that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals *are* capable of forming intentions.  What I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive behaviour to have moral significance since it seems to me  such behaviour does *not* involve intention.   That\s not the point.   The point is whether the implementor thinks *at all*.    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A or opinion B but whether thinking takes place period.   Since humans are part of nature are not all human actions natural.  Or perhaps you\re going to throw in a definition of natural that will allow us to describe some actions as natural and some as  not natural.   If so what is the definition?    Sure they do as multiple posters have show you.   Sharks for example eat wounded sharks.   I\ve personally seen cats eat their newborn.  Are you in some kind of denial?

You may claim that sanitation plants are strategic legitimate targets but what happens to the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals can\t handle the resultant epidemics because there is no more electricity?

Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion but there is  presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument this  statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur\an is a perfect religious  text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for  disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.  I\ve already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam

It is good to remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination. It is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer. Not unlike the rest of your arguments.       I am extremely wary of the way you use words. Like in this case there are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by themselves and others theists. I have pointed to that in my post. You use one of them.   Your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption: because my moral is objective/absolute or the other buzz words you are so fond of everybody will know it and there is no need to define it more exactly.

Text: This response originally fell into a bit bucket.  I\m reposting it just so Bill doesn\t think I\m ignoring him.   Bill  I\m sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this.  Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism needn\t imply materialism or the lack of an absolute moral system.  However I do tend to materialism and don\t believe in absolute morality so I\ll answer your questions.   An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don\t believe in an absolute one doesn\t mean that I don\t have one.  I\m just explicit as in the line of postings you followed up that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me be they Christians Muslims or atheists.  So when I say that I object to genocide I\m not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds.  If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies thereby achieving considerable survival advantages.  You\d probably say that God just made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other but we share a common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it from your religion I think I get it (and you get it) from early childhood teaching.   I think you\ve been reading the wrong sort of comic books but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you\re saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites is mechanistic but of course I think that\s true of you as well.  My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does but if a god existed who commanded genocide I could not consider him good which is supposedly an attribute of God.   Hmm.  Yes I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In fact I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion by framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands then the quality of life will be generally poor so a system that fosters coexistence is superior if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An absolutist on the other hand can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with and say this is good even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as excluded from discussion such that they cannot participate and their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well) and presumably the resort of someone who can\t rationally defend their own ideas of right wrong and the Bible. --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support Inc.

Text: Another one rescued from the bit bucket...  Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and elsewhere on the net.  Generally the discussion comes down to the contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against Islam as to merit if not death than at least banning and probably some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie particularly as a non-muslim in a Western country had every right to write and publish whatever he chose regardless of whether some muslims find it offensive without fear of persecution or death.    I am naturally inclined to the latter position but find myself in an interesting position because I think this is a fine book only incidentally concerned with Islam and moreover I\m damned if I can find anything malevolently offensive in it.  Over the years when I have made this point various primarily muslim posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book and had called it such things as filth and lies I would rank Rushdie\s book with Hitler\s Mein Kempf or worse and so on. Unfortunately these comments are usually generalities and attempts to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so offensive have met either with stony silence more generalizations or inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to believe that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.  Anyway since I seem to be the only one following this particular line of discussion I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have read this book?  What are your thoughts on it?   --  Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support Inc. Matthews NC These are my opinions.  For a nominal fee

Text: [This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan].  predicitions if you have some many types of happen again may predict reaction  There are several problems here. First you are discussing only experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be the result of an experiment or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense.  Secondly repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. The observation of a fossil is \repeatable\ since any qualified observer may look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.  Unfortunately for you the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).  So in fact

Religion is a memetic virus.  people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from religion -> Religion.  people that want to save others are firmly entrenched in Religion (memoids).  rule #1 of not practicing Religion is to shut the fuck up unless you discuss it politely.  this means that the motive behind the conversation is not only your self-gratifying wish to spread the word.    religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person and reflects their value judgements.  Religion is something that is contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements (other than perhaps i think i\ll be brainwashed today).

Women\s right to own property is revoked and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  The Existence of God (Revised Edition) Clarendon Paperbacks Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism (1977) and was concluded with Faith and Reason (1981).  In this work Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in Mackie\s The Miracle of Theism.  In the revised edition of The Existence of God Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  The Miracle of Theism Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as replacements for God such as Lelie\s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin\s works and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

Text:  Bill I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of  belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that  for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.  I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might  revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.  Cheers

However I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims which are always made clearly.   I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and  other such opaque concepts often used by people to camoflage the  baselessness of their positions particularly in matters of theology.

Text:  That\s fascinating.  I take it that you\re expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You could be right but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here\s some more:     Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding    fathers but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany    Plan of Union and later the Articles of Confederation and the    Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts    and from history and from media is not surprising given the devotion    Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were    revealed that Indians had a role in it imagine the blow to the    American psyche.    ...       By 1754 when most of these men and others gathered to creat the    Albany Plan of Union the first try at confederation they invited    forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors    on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged    his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at    Albany Congress: It would be a strange thing...if six nations    of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union    and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted    for ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should    be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.       According to Grinde Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs    and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he    acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.  Grinde is Professor Donald GrindeJr.

Text: [reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\Dwyer)]       If the Good is undefined (undefinable?) but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism.     Ditto here.  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it.     Pretty perceptive that Prof. Flew.       Please explain how this helps.  I don\t see your argument.       This makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the subjectivist.  Furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing *except* science materialism revolution and the People.       And also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by others.  Ditch the strawman already

Text: FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY                        by Robert E. McElwaine Physicist                           Ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a            heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would            violate the laws of physics.  All of the experts and            authorities said so.                            For example Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  The            demonstration that no possible combination of known            substances known forms of machinery and known forms of            force can be united in a practical machine by which man            shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer            as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any            physical fact to be.                            Fortunately a few SMART people such as the Wright            Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final            word.  Now we take airplanes for granted (except when they            crash).                            Today orthodox physicists and other scientists are            saying similar things against several kinds of \Free Energy\            Technologies using negative terms such as pseudo-science            and perpetual motion and citing so-called laws which            assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed (1st law            of thermodynamics) and there is always a decrease in useful            energy (2nd law of thermodynamics).  The physicists do not            know how to do certain things so they ARROGANTLY declare            that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF            IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern science and help to            cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox            modern theories.                            Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a            seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe with-           OUT burning any kind of fuel making them the PERFECT            SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated            pollution degradation and depletion of the environment.                            Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy            but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by            various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices            they need little or no energy storage capacity because they            can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy            has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by            clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced            by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and            high latitudes.  Likewise wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and            often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are            suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly            designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations.                            For example at least three U.S. patents (#3811058            #3879622 and #4151431) have so far been awarded for            motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS seemingly            tapping into energy circulating through the earth\s magnetic            field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to            be self-running.  The third one as described in detail in            Science & Mechanics magazine Spring 1980 (Amazing            Magnet-Powered Motor by Jorma Hyypia pages 45-48 114-117            and front cover) requires critical sizes shapes            orientations and spacings of magnets but NO feedback.  Such            a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible            heatpump in one\s home YEAR ROUND FOR FREE.  [Complete            descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $3.00 each from the            U.S. Patent Office 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy. Arlington VA             22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.  Or try            getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your            local public or university library\s inter-library loan            dept..]                            A second type of free-energy device such as the \Gray            Motor\ (U.S. Patent #3890548) the \Tesla Coil\ and the            motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE 2-10-84 pages            571-2.] taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from            \EARTH RESONANCE\ (about 12 cycles per second plus            harmonics).  They typically have a \SPARK GAP\ in the circuit            which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the            energy being tapped.  It is important that the total            \inductance\ and \capacitance\ of the Device combine to            \RESONATE\ at the same frequency as \EARTH RESONANCE\ in            order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be            increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \NEUTRAL CENTER\            of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a            Tesla Coil slipping a \TOROID CHOKE COIL\ around the            secondary coil will enhance output power.  [Earth Energy:            Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems by John Bigelow 1976            Health Research P.O. Box 70 Mokelumne Hill CA  95245.]                            During the 1930\s an Austrian civil engineer named            Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an            \IMPLOSION TURBINE\ (German name \ZOKWENDLE\) after            analyzing erosion and lack of erosion in differently shaped            waterways and developing sophisticated mathematical            equations to explain it.  As described in the book A            Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources by Dan A. Davidson            1977 water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a            LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a            CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES no longer            touching the inside walls of the tubing and drives the pump            which then converts the pump\s motor into an ELECTRIC            GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that            of the earth\s rotation via the \Coriolis effect\ LIKE A            TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ]                            A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \McClintock            Air Motor\ (U.S. Patent #2982261) which is a cross between            a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression            ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and            planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL but becomes self-running            by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also            generates a lot of heat which could be used to heat            buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large            trucks preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.             [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the            automatic transmission differential and 4-wheel drive.]                            Crystals may someday be used to supply energy as shown            in the Star Trek shows perhaps by inserting each one between            metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of            particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a            common household smoke detector.                            One other energy source should be mentioned here            despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free            Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph            Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION            reactor which he calls \Migma\ which uses NON-radioactive            deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities            from sea water] does NOT produce radioactive waste can be            converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting            steam turbines) and can be constructed small enough to power            a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the            Tokamaks and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about            Migma WORKS already producing at least three watts of power            for every watt put in.  [New Times (U.S. version) 6-26-78            pages 32-40.]                            And then there are the \cold fusion\ experiments that            have been in the news lately originally conducted by            University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin            Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake            Naval Weapons Center in California under the direction of            chemist Melvin Miles finally took the trouble to collect the            bubbles coming from such an apparatus had them analyzed with            mass-spectrometry techniques and found HELIUM 4 which            PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place and enough            of it to explain the excess heat generated.                            There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called laws            of thermodynamics are NOT so absolute.  For example the            late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe which he            calls the \Reciprocal System\ (which he describes in detail            in several books such as Nothing But Motion (1979) and The            Universe of Motion (1984)) in which the physical universe            has TWO DISTINCT HALVES the material half and an anti-matter            half with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing            between them with-OUT the heat death predicted by            thermodynamic laws.  His Theory explains the universe MUCH            BETTER than modern orthodox theories including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some            Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow            seemingly converting low-quality energy into high-quality            energy.                            Also certain religious organizations such as \Sant Mat\            and \Eckankar\ teach their Members that the physical universe            is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of            existence like parallel universes or analogous to TV            channels as described in books like The Path of the            Masters by Dr. Julian Johnson 1939 and Eckankar: The Key            to Secret Worlds by Sri Paul Twitchell 1969.  For example            the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the \Astral Plane\.  Long-time Members of these groups            have learned to \Soul Travel\ into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe or be created at the boundary between them given            the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is            supported by many successful laboratory-controlled            experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world such as            those described in the book Psychic Discoveries Behind the            Iron Curtain.                            In terms of economics the market has FAILED.  Inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment and the conventional            energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their            VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If            the government does not intervene then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out prices for energy will increase and            pollution and its harmful effects (including the \GREENHOUSE            EFFECT\ acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil            spills rape of the land by strip mining etc.) will continue            to increase.                            The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development            of Free Energy by Inventors and universities subsidize            private production (until the producers can make it on their            own) and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of            Free Energy Hardware.                            The long-range effects of such government intervention            would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining            companie$ oil companie$ and countries electric utilitie$            etc.) would drop to near zero forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal uranium oil            and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero            while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\s            personal computers etc.).  Costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease            along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be            able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE            USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR.                            Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of            business but society as a whole and the earth\s environment            and ecosystems would benefit greatly.  It is the People            that government should serve rather than the big            corporation$ and bank$.

Text:   Well yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories.  There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same errors.  This would appear to tell us that at least from some point people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is we don\t know what they did before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and in some situations such as the end of Mark material is lost)

Text: RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28 1992  \t\tWHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE  I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC  \tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture you could have but you chose to wait.  Now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  Tribulation.  But he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be  saved. - Matthew 24:13  II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION  \tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ\s second coming.  Also know as the time of Jacob\s (Israel\s) trouble (Jere 30:7) and Daniel\s Seventieth Week (Dan 9) this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.  III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM  \tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community  (the revived Roman Empire) Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason.  The Bible however will be your most valuable  possession during the Tribulation.  IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  \tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel Luke 21 Matthew 24  Revelation and Amos for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you.    V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE  \tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray  and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ.    VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS  \tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community he will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be useless.  And he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and  slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast  or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man: His number is 666 - Revelation 13:16-18.   \tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past such as the Holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -M] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\s rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ...I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of  them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer  until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were was completed. Revelation 6:9 11. \tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ...And I saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of  God who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands. - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you even your children  torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark.   \tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image however you will be consigned to the second death which is the Lake of Fire. [Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M] You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire.  ...If anyone worships the Beast and his image and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out full strength into the cup of His  indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. -Revelation  14:9-10   [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5000 at the stadium --M]   VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL  \tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\s government until the end of the Tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake. \tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area for the Antichrist\s control will come last to the least populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation. [As you can see on the weather map heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound and perhaps school closings --M]  Store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [Get a good water filter. --M] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons as well as flashlights batteries generators and First Aid supplies.  In short learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.  VIII. TRUST NO ONE \t \tThere will be secret agents everywhere spying for the Antichrist\s government.  Be on the lookout. [Perot supporters take note --M]  IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST  \tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel  11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be  physically appealing highly intelligent with Christ-like charisma and  personality.  An international politician military tactician and economic expert his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews which he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible you too will be deceived.

Text:   (Deletion)   The reference to it\s not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms absolute objective and others interchangeably. Same with moral values values at all worth measuers and usefulness. You infer from them as if they were the same.   To the IF. When the If is not fulfilled your intermission is a waste of time. Assuming that you don\t intend this it is reasonable to conclude that you want to argue a point.   You have made a interesting statement here namely that of the disinterested observer. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for objective and morality being a contradiction.       Fine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn\t mentioned before). In other words you have nothing to fulfill your strong claims with.       Clutching a straw. I don\t believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were loaded terms are fixpoints. Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite clear what they say their practice is telling. Yes there are even those who are willingly unfree. It is quite common in religions by the way. For one there is a religion which is named Submission.

For example Islamic banks don\t pay fixed interests on deposits but a return on investments (which varies according to the market and is not fixed like interest is).  Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world. There are no Islamic banks in the West including the USA to my knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not while Islamic banks are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an Islamic bank -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the answer to this question is yes then BCCI was not an Islamic bank

Text:  Probably because it IS rape.   So nothing.  It may work for some but not for others: it doesn\t give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual as well as individually-created.  And since Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better than ours I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary or even particularly attractive.   Well we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not but at the very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that say there was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago then there is a supernatural diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.   This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily documented and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible and that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination or one\s ignorance.  Someone else will address this I\m sure and refer you to plenty of documentation...   How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.   Well since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness) there is no way to get into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge.  If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will feel right and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction... I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed many of us were not.  The question is is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect fanaticism for example

Text:   I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I don\t think Plato would have been happy with this and neither would Paul although Paul\s ideas were quite different. However if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group and not just preach you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements.  The same applies to the theory of natural selection or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don\t believe in spirits devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.   Ah you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed all along.    You might be as well planting Satan\s seeds ever thought of this? Besides you haven\t yet explained why we must believe so blindly without any guiding light at all (at least I haven\t noticed it). I don\t think this is at all fair play on god\s part.   Your argument sounds like a version of Pascal\s Wager. Please read the FAQ this fallacy is discussed there.   And I failed to get help from the HS because I had a wrong attitude?

Text:  Wow! You got me thinking now!  This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a  move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal  activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two  coexisting methods of social control.  First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of  actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set  of punishments.  Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are  the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered  by legal control are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if  socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed  since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of  social censure.  The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as guilt and  morality.  I\ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\t for  the VAST majority of people policing themselves legal control would be  absolutely impossible.  Lately (last 50 100 years?) however there has been a move to  attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\t  illegal then don\t pick on me).  I\m not saying this is wrong merely  that it is a byproduct of a society which has:  \t1) A high education level \t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media \t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights and \t4) A me oriented culture.  I guess what I\m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition  here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can can\t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness yet we  are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as  those freedoms don\t impinge on another\s.  IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.

Text:     Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined rules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented at the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for that case would be the citizens of the US and so on.   Acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are non-verbally and in effect non-consciously such as picking your nose on the Oprah Winfrey show no-one does it but there is no explicit law against doing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a behaviour is acceptable but one can deduce these behaviours by observation.    In an increasingly litigation mad society this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in American (and Australian to bring in my local perspective) culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance some cultures\ dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals. Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However is it moral according to the multicultural american society? This kind of problem may only be definable by legislation.   Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is acceptable behaviour or not and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.    One thing is for sure there is no universal moral code which will suit all cultures in all situations.  There may however

One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be interpreted even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example The best thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement.  whatever helps this goal is moral whatever does not is immoral  Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to fulfill a goal one would need a hyper-morality to apply to just the methods.   Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think about it long enough  :)  On the other hand maybe it is our first gut reaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate morals.  I don\t instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I instinctively feel torture is wrong) but if I thought about it long enough and listened to the arguments I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that possible!?  :) )  See the difference?  --    best regards

The onus of proof is on you sunshine.  What makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism but it\s there for anyone to see.  It\s almost an epidemic in this country.  Just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\ the eye of a needle why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why are there churches to the square inch in my country? #  #>#>Now *some* #>#>brands of theism and more precisely *some* theists do tend to fanaticism #>#>I grant you.

Not all theism as is is fanatic. However the rest already #gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and #theism. And further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them #to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the #theology.  Truth by blatant assertion.   #  #  #>#Gullibility by the way is one of them. #> #>No shit Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility i
