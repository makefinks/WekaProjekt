'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.  \tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i.e. only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively \tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume \tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not \texactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable \tmeasure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment \tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two \ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order project onto a 2D pixmap

'Sorry I missed you Raymond I was just out in Dahlgren last month...  I\'m the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics so perhaps I can help a little.    Unfortunately while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man those are film-quality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time (30 frames per second).     It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. True immersive visualization (VR) requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training. If the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations.  Additionally the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before) the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general does not support real-time operation but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes.  Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10 not HP 700 Series systems not IBM RS-6000 not even SGI\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.  From a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.    You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop VR applications but that is starting at a pretty low level.

'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer.   I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example in the letter O there are two outlines:  \t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font) \t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes. The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:  \t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple \t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for \t\tsome fancy fonts). \t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.

'****************************   SPHINX   ***************************  \tSphinx is a user-friendly state-of-the-art image processing and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance  computer platforms operating UNIX and the X-Window System.  \tIt was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.   \t\t   Intuitive Graphic Interface  \tSphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast. \tThis accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.  \t\t    Image Format Compatibility  \tUsing smart read/write functions Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.  \t\t    Image Analysis & Processing  \tFor image and pixel analysis the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations such as Fourier transforms convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.  \t\t    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis  \tSphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g. GOES METEOSAT NOAA Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles warping orbit simulation and 3-D image projection.  \t\t    Easy External Program Interfacing  \tSphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.  \t\t    Quick Quality Presentation  \tSphinx rapidly displays manipulates and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane the package conveniently combines color images graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx\'s 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers. \tOther Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation external  graphics importing mosaic fitting... what else?  \t\t    Software Support & Development  \t Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d\'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the French space agency Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package which features on-line help is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.  \t\t    Performance Tested   \tCNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l\'Environnement Ecole Normale Superieure  Laboratoire d\' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.

'I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn\'t work.  I may be misinterpreting of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes I was taking the midpoint of the line from say P1 to P2 and setting the normal as the normalized vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty but it looks like I need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bringing in another routine I don\'t have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However

' I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel. I would suggest that you take your code and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites).  Many folks myself included would enjoy the extra code.   Just to clarify the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However it is quite limited in the sense that it\'s a low-level 3D library; your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing on GL for example where you can handle objects.  Other things to consider when talking about Apple\'s old 3D GrafSys library:  * Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future  * Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...

'Printer model and specification:  Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)   Hello  We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer.  We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The  copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the printer with the lp system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs such as showcase xv and tops.  When we convert to postscript  with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98  rather than the default 40 the output is better but still much less that  acceptable.  Note that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript.  We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality  pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a  warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work.   Here my questions:  If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or  parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?  Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the limiting component the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer?   The Big question:  Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?    Please email directly to me

'    Sean the 68070 exists! :-)       Sean I don\'t want to get into a \'mini-war\' by what I am going to say but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris you\'ll see why (please no-flames I reserve those for c.s.m.a :-) )     I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a booth there.  I walked by and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn\'t 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don\'t know what model 900?) to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn\'t even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMind\'s Accelerator?)?     Don\'t misunderstand me I just want to clarify this.     But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not I can claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256000+ colors in  my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

' Sorry!! :-)  Call the four points A B C and D. Any three of them must be non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).  A B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB BC and CA  meet in a point (P say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.  Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one.  Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).

'Hi! Everyone  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week I guess my question was not so clear. Now I\'d like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn\'t touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right it is not. However so many people involved in the problem sphere from 4 poits. Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters

'In regards to fractal commpression I have seen 2 fractal compressed movies. They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale movie of Casablanca it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.  I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.

' Basically there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In this method you can draw any ray if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even then it is outside. If the number is odd then it is inside. Of cause you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache.  The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines. If the result is 2*PI then it is inside. If PI

'Hi.  I\'m writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I\'ve written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I\'ve used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert but if I don\'t know which way they are stored I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn\'t handle this can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...  Thanks in advance for any help

'[snip] (the 3DO is not a 68000!!!) [snip]   The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor one or two custom graphics chips a DSP a double-speed CDROM and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I\'m a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).  It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica CA. From 3DO RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal Josephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec (which was nice very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft) ... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).  Note however that the 3DO\'s screen resolution is 320x240.  CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above... I\'m sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The price of generality... personally I don\'t use the dynamic sizing of movies often if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines.  I\'m not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in the 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster
' OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable.   If your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot.   As one of the previous posts stated the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20 4D/25 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time. As a rule of thumb SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\'85-\'89) the PI (\'88-\'93) the Professional Series (the early 4D\'s - \'86-\'90) the Power Series parallel systems (\'88-\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics architectures at the high end (GT VGX RealityEngine) are released every 18 months to 2 years.  These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform (like Indigo Onyx Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths faster CPUs faster graphics and I/O and larger disk capacities. If we don\'t we become uncompetitive.  From the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\'t wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the Sales Rep for one in writing. If it\'s feasible they should be able to do that. Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.   If that\'s happening it\'s becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base.   Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments.   Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.  There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don\'t give up
' #I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the #ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is  I don\'t like xpr. It gives (at least the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer try: \txwdtopnm <xwdfile> |\t# convert to PPM \t[ppmtopgm |]\t\t# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print \tpnmtops -noturn |\t# .. to PostScript \tlpr\t\t\t# print  pnmtops Has several neat options but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4 wide use: \tpnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it \tis high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small it may fit within a \twidth less than 4 and will thus be printed smaller than 4 wide. \tIf you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in 4 and \twill be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified \tpaper width.  \tIn short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size

'   A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the plane (it may require you to give it a cut though...)  E.g. a cylinder a cone a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e. with singular Hessian the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch) are developable. In more technical words a developable surface is locally isometric to a plane at all points.   Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable: whatever way(s) you cut it you will not be able to lay flat any pieces of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).  For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry which treats surfaces (2D manifolds); e.g. M. do Carmo\'s book:  @Book{Carmo76Differential   author =      {do Carmo Manfredo P.}   title =       {Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces}   year =        1976   publisher =   {Prentice-Hall}

'    Rather than decide which book you want to buy you need to decide which programming interface you want to use then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here\'s a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called PEX.  PEXlib is a slightly lower level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with XlibXtMotifetc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of policy - PEX supports PHIGS but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices not just X based ones - Support for archiving metafiles hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you\'re working strictly in X and don\'t care about things like archiving I would go with PEXlib.  Either way

'Hi everyone  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user non-immersive X-Windows based Virtual Reality system primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:     Client-Server based model using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient point and spot).    Objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a \'fast\' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user\'s    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user\'s    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don\'t need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for \tfaster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn\'t support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can\'t but because    I don\'t have one! This will however be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT MOVE CHANGE COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That\'s all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I\'ve provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar) Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and I\'m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I\'ve certainly found fascinating developing it and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!  Finally one major disclaimer:  This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code other than what I out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!  Disclaimer over!

' It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either confused or less than honest/ethical or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20 25 30 35) although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35 over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn\'t be pushed any further.  I\'d say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our minds to push it further and I *know* that was made clear almost from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan which I also think is pretty good.   Please by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure sometimes there will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available but that shouldn\'t last too long and doesn\'t seem to be what you are referring to).  Yes the sales folks *do* get bonus\'s at the end of some (all?) quarters but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that aren\'t what they need I\'m sure but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter after all...)   They don\'t get all that long a lead time either; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions may well influence the end product but that also is life in the industry.  We can\'t design systems that meet just their needs or we won\'t sell too many systems after all (which is not to say that we don\'t have some niche products like Reality Engine).   But surely you don\'t expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period?  That\'s a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience (with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported and parts available yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!   I missed your first posting but as I say by all means share your frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might have an effect (not immediate I\'m sure but complaints aren\'t going to be ignored and *may* affect future plans if we  hear similar things from more than one person/site).  All of the above is as usual my personal opinion

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the object\'s hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse\'s axis for this image distortion?  So please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?  We\'d appreciate any help either posted or emailed.  Thanks in advance

' It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (xy) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(xy) to the Reference(xy)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (xy)\'s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (xy)\'s).  2) For every point compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (xy) points for which you know the Reference(xy) you        can move alpha0*(Reference(xy) - Current(xy)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(xy) towards the        Reference(xy).      b) For all other points examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where correct is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(xy) - i.e. do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially you can\'t allow the convex hull to change and you can\'t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.

' No.  That\'s *not* what I was complaining about nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the Lynx some day but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL rather than deal further with SGI.  What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  I\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter) but I\'m just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe it\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies so we aren\'t entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids (NASA for instance) are.  This lab and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesn\'t have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we can\'t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.

I\'m going to be looking at this box for the next five years.

'What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

Note the early use of PostScript technology predating many of this year\'s papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??) \tby Dave Baraff Tom Duff  \tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu \tNewsgroups: comp.graphics \tKeywords: P NP Jordan curve separation Ursyhon Metrization Theorem \tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus the line lies completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See PostScript Language by Adobe Systems Incorporated ISBN # 0-201-10179-3 co. 1985).  So given a line L and a polygon P we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P and then outputs the answer.  By output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.   \t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the \treduced problem Q.  So we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of \tChoice (or equivalently Zorn\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of \tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.  \t(2) More importantly the question arises as to whether or not the \tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in \tother words will it halt?  \tNow PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a \tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is \tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn \tout to be undecidable.   I won\'t even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite precision and running out of ink paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better he\'s hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin J. Comp. Obfusc. 37ii:  pp. 33-947 lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit without(!) the use of Grobner bases so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well sure its no worse than NP-complete

'------------------------------------- \t+ ............The OTIS Project \'93  +       \t+ The Operative Term Is STIMULATE +  \t------------------------------------- \t---this file last updated..4-21-93---   WHAT IS OTIS?  OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\'ll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\'ll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it\'s stimulus it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you\'ve got the gumption... that\'s what they\'re here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.      \t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis) the UWI site \t\t \tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS) the SUNsite  \t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely anonymous FTP to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don\'t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you\'re in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff... \tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines \tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo get it scanned into an image file then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS\' directories house two types of image files GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require oddly enough a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can\'t find one but do have a GIF viewer   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also include some biographical information on yourself we\'ll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures but no scanner there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well.     Conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we\'ll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk peachy.  Merely send a 3.5 disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\'d just rather not have to.  At senders request we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don\'t have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93 we\'re at about 18 megabytes of files and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you\'d send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this info-file there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory you\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication or full address credit).  You will either find this in the .rm file for     the image or series of images...or in the Artists directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn\'t explicitly given then you\'ll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu) and I\'ll get in contact with the artist for  you or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work it\'s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in dos format.  That means keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number. Thus Leonardo DeVinci\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:   \tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title address or other information you\'d like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That\'s about it for now.  More guidelines will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS    \t     (a sumerian deity) or it\'s followers be they pope priest \t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations \t     however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original   \t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.   \t     It\'s possible as with any form of mass-media that someone \t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.       \t     Unless you\'ve given permission for that it\'s illegal.  OTIS \t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms all rights \t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to  \t     give permission for it to be viewed copied and distributed  \t     electronically.  If you don\'t want your images distributed      \t     all-over don\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is \t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or \t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes but is not  \t     limited to magazines newsletters clip-art software         \t     screen-printed clothing etc).  You must give specific \t     permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember
'Sketch:  Rotate so cylinder axis is || Z axis.  Intersect X/Y projection of line with projected cylinder (similar to but easier than sphere intersection).  Result: no intersection one intersection or two intersections parameterized along line by t0 and t1.  Now look at Z and compute intersections of line with top and bottom planes of cylinder.  This gives t0\' and t1\'.  The interval of intersection is then the bit of the line from [t0t1] INTERSECT [t0\'

'Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0 being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge\'s UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100\% written in C and the programming interface conforms to C    standards taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for two-call    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.

'  I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.  The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1) I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2) I felt DEC\'s history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry average and that in my opinion SGI\'s history is better than DEC\'s.  (And what is DEC doing with it\'s MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to abandon it for their Alpha based line

'Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode but they didn\'t have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call Japan etc.  Frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source it can\'t store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It\'s not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing

'I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature. This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:  \tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25 \t Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in .25.  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:  \tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25 \t This results in all the coordinates ending in either 0.25 or 0.75  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS result looks better than how my stuff looks I\'d like to know if anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.  Thanks

' I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF and it usually works very well.  That\'s not my point.  I\'m >philosophically< opposed to it because of its complexity.  This complexity has led to some programs\' poor TIFF writers making some very bizarre files other programs\' inability to load TIFF images (though they\'ll save them of course) and a general inability to interchange images between different environments despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.  As the saying goes It\'s not me I\'m worried about- it\'s all the abuse of TIFF over the years and I chalk it all up to the immense (and unnecessary) complexity of the format.  In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec Appendix G page G-1 (capitalized emphasis mine):  The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB) and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be able to import any TIFF image since there are so many image-generating applications out there now.   If a program (or worse all applications) can\'t read >every< TIFF image that means there are some it won\'t- some that I might have to deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I don\'t and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not that anyone does

Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).  Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and the result should be ok.  You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have more than 256 unique rgb triplets

The long answer is yes - but a few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix\'s are the same you know! As far as many bugs go it would probably be more useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)  Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000 Dec Ultrix Sun Solaris so it is possible.  The main problem is that I don\'t have access to other platforms than the RS6000 so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to how to fix it.  As far as the software not doing anything do you really think I would bother releasing it if that was the case? Perhaps you didn\'t read the few docs that ARE supplied.

' Yeah and it\'s also true most long complicated sequences of events calculations or big computer programs in general.  I don\'t argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but I don\'t think it has much to do with fractals and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal compression for a few years and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so great how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t I\'ll wager.  Actually I have wagered I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat though. :-)  I\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I don\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work but I don\'t see anyone using it in a real product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed right?  \tThere are always going to be questions until there\'s a product \tout there Sloan replies.

'  Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear full digital editing.  If you\'re considering such a system here are the pros and cons:  For the educational environment this system is excellent.  We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net.  We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use image quality is not critical.  The Digital Film system for those of you who are uninitiated is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac the maker of the card is trying to achieve this quality level but as yet has been unable to deliver.  Our system produces near VHS quality at 30 fields per second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting.  If you can get past this problem you\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.  Because of its non-linear nature editing is fast and easy.  If you\'ve ever used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system you\'ll recognize the methodology and the user interface.  The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM) 1 gig drive 21 Apple mon- itor Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck audio gear (cassette CD EQ mixer etc) Composite monitor Digital Film card will set you back about $20000.  For you video cowboys and girls this system will not output at a quality that will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more effects than a toasterhead can imagine

' [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255 the second only for pixels that had value 254 etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to \'or\' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed

Traditionally they have used pictures words demonstrations     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions a confounded user asks: What does it all mean?      Since image construction transmission reception decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks strongly influenced by     physiology education and culture; and since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step then we as electronic     communicators must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines including but not limited to the     physical biological and computational sciences technology art     psychology philosophy and education in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

'Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator? There are a few Unix versions for it available depending on your platform. I know of two Unix versions: One for Mach (NeXT) and for Irix (SGI). There may be others such as for Sun SparcStation but I don\'t know for sure.  ttyl
'There is a new product for the (IBM\'ers) out there... it is called IMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday... I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3D-Studio.  It is made by IMPUlSE and is in its 3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing your standard key-framming animation it is a raytracer (reflections & shadows) and can do/apply special FX to objects...

'Hi   \tIs anyone into medical imaging?  I have a good ray tracing background and I\'m interested in that field.  Could you point me to some sources?  Or better yet if you have any experience
' I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the tracing utility (can\'t remember the name sorry!) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL\'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this which makes the solution less than idea is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.  The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel.  OUCH! I\'ve done it a few times :-]                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  As I say if you don\'t mind the problems
'I\'m interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video mathematically.  What is the transform?  Is it a simple reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space?  Is it a manipulation in the YUV color space?  How is it related to solarization?  If you want to see something truly wild turn on the reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped and point it at the monitor.  This creates a chaotic dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along rotation zoom focus etc.  Very very surprising and  lovely.  I\'d like to write a simulation of this effect without analog grunge.  Thanks for any info you may have.  Please e-mail any info to me.  I\'ll post a summary.  Thanks

' (1) No explicit (c) is necessary.  If it the image is attributed to the Geosphere Company then there is a likelihood permission is has been given to reprint.  (2) Unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals. However interesting images do make their way into ads and computer demos. That is when a pirate might get some flak. This image is considered so interesting that many people would like to use it whenever some global map is needed so there is lots of temptation.  (3) One mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery- is not copyrighted then the derived image can\'t be.  Not true. A new distinctive creative expression of the data can be protected. This image is certainly fits such since NO ONE ELSE has taken the tremendous effort to re-create it themselves.  Precedent is a recent telephone book court case.  Ma Bell tried to copyright the data in their books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are trick entries in the book).  But the court only permitted copyright of the expression of the data

'Hi all I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color Graphical BBS that supports PC Mac Linux and Amiga callers.  Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of  which hit this group about 2 weeks ago).  Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn\'t)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC Mac

'   It\'s not a bad question: I don\'t have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit it shouldn\'t be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere\'s origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute it\'s just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I\'ll leave the math to you but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes

'There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.  The points (xyz) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (abc) can be written as      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2  This equation can be rewritten into the following form:       2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2  Approximate the left hand part by   F(xyz) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1  For all datapoints i.c. 4 determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(xyz) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.  In \'Numerical Recipes in C\' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.  The best fitting sphere will have  - center (abc) = (p1/2 p2/2 p3/2) - radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).  So at last will this solve you sphere estination problem

'Let\'s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true xy positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case using Yaron Danon\'s excellent Digitize program).  That is you use a program which converts cursor positions to xy and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular if I have three sets of points   Reference(xy) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(xy) (the same points with known errors)  DistortedData(xy) (other points with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 3d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas or better yet pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?  Thanks
'Hello
'Read Issue #2 of Wired Magazine.  It has a long article on the hype of 3DO.  I\'ve noticed that every article talks with the designers and how great it is
' This algorithm works well for me:  Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals: --------------------------------------------------- First mark all faces as UNKNOWN.  Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point calculate a volume measurement taking into account the face\'s orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display   enhancing smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   program with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering numerical analysis statistics etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs power spectra filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography   surveillance machine vision production testing biomedical imaging   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement histogram equalization spatial and   frequency filtering isolation of features thresholding mathematical   morphology analysis density measurement object counting sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 a pixel   depth of 8 16 or 32 bits and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT TIFF SATIE and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations spatial   linear and non-linear filters frequency filtering arithmetic and logic   operations and geometric transformations among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion dilation opening closing hole   removal object separation and extraction of skeletons among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects\' detection measurement and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area perimeter center of   gravity moment of inertia orientation length of relevant chords and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images noise removal making comparisons etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real  imaginary ) components or the (phase magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding eroding dilating and even   hole filling.    The program\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area   perimeter center of mass object counts and angle between points.    GTFS Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications   documentation and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.    Spyglass Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign IL  61820 (217) 355-6000   fax: 217 355 8925  NIH IMAGE ---------   Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)   zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32] directory:/pub/image.   It has painting and image manipulation tools a macro language   tools for measuring areas distances and angles and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.  Video-rate   capture display processing and analysis of high-resolution   monochromatic and color images.  Includes C source code.  TCL-Image:   Software package for scientific quantitative image processing and   analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture enhancement   and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.   TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing and contains the   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm   development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily   extensible through script (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types such as PICT2 and TIFF.    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You\'ll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn\'t   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith Jet   Propulsion Laboratory MS 300-323 4800 Oak Grove Dr.Pasadena CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser pencil brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100\%   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast color balancing hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image   blur edges or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms including externally supplied compression such as JPEG   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF   EPSF TIFF PICT resource Amiga IFF/ILBM CompuServe GIF MacPaint   PIXAR PixelPaint Scitex CT TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color close   hues color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don\'t know...    Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus NJ 07653 201-845-6100  Dapple Systems --------------   High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to   work with multiple images enhance and edit and measure a variety of   global or feature parameters and interpret the data.    Dapple Systems 355 W. Olive Ave #100 Sunnyvale CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by painting it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator paint with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd. Suite J San Diego CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0  requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement 3D and contour plots image statistics supervised and   unsupervised classification PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose.    Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn\'t have all the inbuilt features of   other packages but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing programs for processing an image defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software.    Process Software Solutions PO Box 2110 Wollongong New South Wales   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: Laplacian medium noise filter etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF PICT EPSF or text (however EPSF files can\'t be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density shape size position or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes without the need for programming the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI the   program can find the distance between two edges the area of a shape   the thickness of a wall etc.  Image Analyst finds the center edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.    Automatix Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica MA 01821 508-667-7900  IPLab -----   Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna VA  22180 703-281-3277   FAX 703-281-2509    Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or   pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.

Windows/DOS PC-based tools ==========================  CCD ---   Richard Berry\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)   disks with image manipulating software.  Source code is included.  ERDAS -----   ERDAS will do all of the things you want:  rectification   classification transformations (canned & user-defined) overlays   filters contrast enhancement etc. ... I was using it on my thesis &   then changed the topic a bit & that work became secondary.    ERDAS Inc. 2801 Buford Highway Suite 300 Atlanta GA 30329 404-248-9000   FAX   404-248-9400  RSVGA -----   I have been getting up to speed on a program called RSVGA available from   Eidetic Digital Image Ltd. in British Columbia.  Its for IBM PC\'s or   clones cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not   as fast or as powerful though I have had only limited experience with   Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good   starter program except for the obtuse manual  IMAGINE-32 ----------   It\'s a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called Imagine32   or Image32 The program does a modest amount of image processing --add   subtract multiply divide display and plot an x or y cut across the image.   It can also display a number of images simultaneously.   The company is CompuScope in Santa Barbara CA.   PC Vista --------   It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to   be available from Mike Richmond whose email addresses have been  \trichmond@bllac.berkeley.edu \trichmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu    and his s-mail address is:    Michael RichmondAstronomy Department Campbell Hall Berkeley CA 94720    The latest version of PC-Vista version 1.7 includes not only the source   code and help files but also a complete set of executable programs and   a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code   you will need Microsoft C version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work   but will require substantial modifications.    To receive the documentation and nine double-density (360K) floppies   (or three quad-density 3-1/2 inch floppies (1.44M) with everything on them   just send a request for PC-Vista together with your name and a US-Mail   address to   \tOffice of Technology Licensing \t2150 Shattuck Ave. Suite 510 \tBerkeley Ca. 94704    Include a check (Traveller\'s Checks are fine) or purchase order for $150.00   in U.S. dollars if your address is inside the continental U.S. or $165.00   otherwise made out to Regents of the University of California   to cover duplication and mailing costs.   SOFTWARE TOOLS --------------   It\'s a set of software tools put out by Canyon State   Systems and Software. They are not free but rather cheap at about $30 I   heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It\'s image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software or something like that and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD\'s vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific 65 Koch Road Corte Madera CA 94925 (415) 924-8640   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista) or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen) but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory HQ in Charlottesville   VA sites in NM AZ WV).  Software distributed by 9-track Exabyte DAT   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103)   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits) and is   primarily for reduction analysis and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes particularly the Very Large Array (VLA) a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules and is   available for Suns IBM RS/6000 Dec/Ultrix Convex Cray (Unicos) and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx Solaris 2.1 and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - AIPS++ - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US Canada England the Netherlands India and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification classification (unsupervised and   supervised) intensity transformations three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\'s environments. Using   the Programmers environment utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables   colour stretches changes to histograms zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass   automatic navigation calibrate it to Albedo and Temp convert that to   byte register it to predesigned window all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of but it isn\'t that   difficult to write your own with their programmer\'s module.    Very small operation: one designs one codes one sells. Been around for   a number of years sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\'s Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics medical satellite engineering oil   exploration etc.).  It is called HIPS and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations filtering convolution Fourier and other transform   processing edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation digital   image compression and transmission  methods noise generation and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters\'\'.  It comes complete with source  code  on-line manual   pages and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation   of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax Sun Apollo  Masscomp  NCR Tower Iris IBM AT etc.   For image display and input drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors and the Sun-2 Sun-3 Sun- 4 and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx Sun   console Matrox VIP-1024 ITI IP-512 Lexidata  Macintosh II X   windowing system and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98\% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an   interactive  research tool and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge) and comes with source code libraries a library of   convolu- tion masks and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats native formats of a number of CCD cameras and uncompressed binary   images in byte short integer and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s) all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale pseudocolor and random palettes is provided and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value polynomial of pixel value chs 1/x log    byteswap clip values at upper/lower limits short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean median mode or sum of pixel values with or    without autoscaling to mean median or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian Sobel edge operator directional gradient    line Gaussian elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters unsharp    masking median filters user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse rectangle    line gradient Gaussian and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding dark subtraction column over/underscan    bias removal remove bad pixels and column defects normalize to    region target mean median or modal value. o  create subimage mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data rename keywords plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry    brightness profile isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances area and luminance inside traced polygon.

' I\'ve got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting).  My gripe about TIFF is that it\'s far too complicated and nearly infinitely easier to write than to read which I think hurts your acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g. paint programs).  In a nutshell I don\'t think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn\'t be TIFF anymore.  They keep trying to cut it back but it\'s late now.

'Hi there  I\'ve made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They\'re intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask I\'ll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple but I\'ve found them to be very fast (for my purposes anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h define a virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots) put a sprite (image with see-thru areas) copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc.  I\'ve also included a simple C routine to draw a line as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

'[Please note the Newsgroups.]  Recent discussion about XV\'s problems were held in some newsgroup. Here is some text users of XV might find interesting. I have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago.  I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can so fine program XV is that it is worth of improving. (I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV e-mail me for them.)  Any misundertanding of mine is understandable.   Juhana Kouhia   ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  Note that \'xv\' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also there\'s three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality depends on them too.   This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.   IMHO it is design error of \'xv\'; there should not be such confusing errors in programs. There\'s two errors:   -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the    original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of    original 24bit should be a special case   -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer    -- the main case should be that \'xv\' quantizes the image with the    best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier    quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases    in saving the image if at all)   ==clip==  ==clip==  [ ..deleted..]  It is limit of *XV* but not limit of design. It is error in design. It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs; jpeg is not designed to that.  As matter of fact I\'m sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images. That were not done and now we have  -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)  -the program has human interface errors.  Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.  [ ..deleted.. ]  ==clip==  Some new items follows.  ==clip==  I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have. The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise) the same than used in ppmquant.  If you remember I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found that rlequant (with default) is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv (our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.  I don\'t know is ppmquant improved any but I expect no. So use of XV\'s -best24 option is not very good idea.  I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- I\'m sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it so I can say nothing about it.)  ==clip==  ==clip==  Some minor bugs in human interface are:  Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately. The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.  Also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is completed. Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when I\'m writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.

'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView. Since he isn\'t in the position to post this himself he asked me to post it for him but to leave his name out. So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its current directory.  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then for 8 bit displays it does the dithering again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last recopy operation for its fit to screen feature even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\'t performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand when choosing files in the Open Files menu CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really

It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact you\'ll have to   compile just the libvplot routines not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions to information about soil types vegetation etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape 3480 cartridge 9-track tape   IBM PC floppy and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented not hobbyist oriented.  For more information   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 public domain tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans).

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner like Epson\'s. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News Volume 4 #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don\'t have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp 1-619-536-9999 sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses such as Comstock   UNIPHOTO and Metro Image Base is available.    In Italy there\'s a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: \tEdition Belvedere Co. Ltd. \t00196 Rome Italy \tPiazzale Flaminio 19 \tTel. (06) 360-44-88 Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas) soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing Andrew Glassner (ed.) Academic Press      1989 ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book but I feel that you can\'t be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There\'s a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda  UNC @ Chapel Hill: An Introduction to Ray Tracing in   Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw   NATO AS Vol. F-40. pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag 1988.  It contains code for a small but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_ David F. Rogers         McGraw-Hill New York 1985 pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  Displays on Display column of IEEE CG&A Jan \'87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell\'s teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep \'87 in Jim Blinn\'s column Jim Blinn\'s Corner describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects so you\'re advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here\'s a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex 146 4-vertex 7 5-vertex 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au  file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu   /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles\' model.  This model is stored in several files each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model\'s distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex 2268 4-vertex 33 5-vertex 14 6-vertex  10 7-vertex 8 8-vertex 8 12-vertex 2 13-vertex 2 15-vertex  17 16-vertex 2 17-vertex 2 18-vertex 3 19-vertex 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs Stanford University for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles but even if your image isn\'t normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\'m not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. \'ice\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\'s a PostScript-based   graphical editorand it\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it\'s an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast merge   synchronization conditional and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented distributed visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions) objects (data structures) and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun HP9000/7xx SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I\'ve heard of besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\'m not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\'ve   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\'s a   freebie if you want it    My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well also. Personally I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica Igor or even   Excel on the Mac if it\'s not too hairy) then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn\'t handle and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way it\'s mostly astronomical   image processing which I\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement   cleaning up bad lines/pixels and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons scrollbars    menus and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation image display and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it\'s public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly compared to Macintosh software. A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering full color on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based has some image-processing capability   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best of course for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software as   well as bug fixes contributed sources documentation and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   tar archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions support concerns miscellaneous questions etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips tricks and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign IL).

If you have questions problems or comments send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip mirror rotate generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass low pass edge enhancing median   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI Inc. out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats: LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS Unix   workstations (among them HP Sun and IBM) and VMS and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The PCI software consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI   database disk file.  The Tape I/O package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO or write those formats out FROM the PCI database file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis equalization user-specified operations (e.g.   multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5) and   God only knows what all else -- there\'s a LOT.  I don\'t have and don\'t   use these so can\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be (in VMS anyway) in your default   directory.  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\'s   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls raw) data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry\'s CT2T format would probably (I haven\'t tried)   handle Targa and so on. Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It\'s worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to   contain not only raster (image) data but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table) land-use and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI database).    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be overkill   in your case; it seems designed for the very high end   applications/users i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\'t suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\'s   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification classification PC and   IHS transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays).   Actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR an executive based on TAE and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\'re interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF   TIN DEM Lattices

No information is required in the subject header line.   1. ARCHIE =========  The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for requested files. It\'s appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type archie as username. To get help type \'help\'. You can get \'xarchie\' or \'archie\' which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. \'Xarchie\' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape and \'archie\' on comp.sources.misc vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail send mail with subject help to archie account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify archie as the host name and archie as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying I can\'t FTP could someone mail this to me?  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above with archie\'s help. Don\'t overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC\'s FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field   and having a line containing the word \'help\'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL send an original mail message not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster since DECWRL\'s postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY there\'s BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line \'help\' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects 24bit JPEG images GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga Atari IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called The Graphics BBS.  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis which has speeds from 300bps up to 38400bps.    If you would like to submit objects scenes or images to the server   please pack uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

Scene description languages ==============================  NFF ---   Neutral file format  by Eric Haines. Very simple there are some   procedural database generators in the SPD package and many objects   floating in various FTP sites. There\'s also a previewer written in   HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there\'s one written in VOGLE so you can   use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.   (Check in sites carrying VOGLE like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)  OFF ---   Object file format from DEC\'s Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com). [ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version  I\'ll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]    Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this   service send a message with a Subject: line containing only the word   help and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.   [For FTP places to get it see in the relevant place]. There\'s an OFF   previewer for SGI 4D machines called off-preview in   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It\'s a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF NFF Rayshade Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News V4#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?) OFF NFF   Rayshade 4.0 or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release so there is no need to   have access to any vendor\'s lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif Open Look and Silicon   Graphics GL and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter\'s Algorithm Dore Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language   Generic Phigs Sun Phigs+ DEC Phigs+ Rayshade ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu directory pub/p3d and nic.funet.fi directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.  RenderMan ---------   Pixar\'s RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.  ==========================================================================  8. Solids description formats =============================  a. EEC\'s ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a   neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves surfaces and   solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided   Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)  b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid   models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987   For documentation you might want to contact Nancy Flower at   NCGA Technical Services and Standards 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325   and the cost is $100.   This standard is not available in electronic format.  c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only   the geometrical information but also for things like FEM etc.   The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get   more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov   and putting the line \tsend index   in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.    The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working   on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser   both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.   Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.    For the tools contact Mike Mead Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893)

'I have a Paradise SVGA with 1Mb the 90c030 chip (1D). The docs say that I can display the following modes : 640x480x32k colours and 800x600x32k cols if I have the RAMDAC HiColor Chip. I have checked the board and I do have such a chip. Now the problem is that I can\'t get this mode to work ! Graphics Workshop 6.1 claims that it can display 24 bit images dithered down to 15 bit colour with my board but it doesn\'t work. I have tried writing some assembler code to get the modes working and I have found out that each pixel is addressed by a word ( 16 bit ) but only the lower 8 bits are considered ( this happens in 800x600 mode

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc. etc.  Conversely if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF for instance).  Thus using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years though 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images GIF is superior in image quality file size or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders overlaid text etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7 which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects then go up.  Except for experimental purposes never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale just high/medium/low-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don\'t know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources. (If you don\'t have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body.  The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful --- it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don\'t see what you want for your machine check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and other image formats.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \'xv-???.tar.Z\' (where ??? is the version number currently 2.21); it is located in the \'contrib\' directory on export or the \'pub/xv\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally which means it\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also you shouldn\'t use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG because they\'ll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version 2.4a is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50) file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version 1.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision 8.60a.  However CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20 that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117) which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway at least for previewing...  JView is freeware fairly fast has good on-line help and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment) but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version 0.9 is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84) file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware $20) displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above) file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register you\'ll get the 386-only version which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway the current version is 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows but only in full-screen mode not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6 you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92 this file contains QuickTime 1.5 which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format PICT/JPEG is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format PICT/JPEG format or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version 2.0 is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion though.)  Some people like this behavior some don\'t.  Overall JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse PictPixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie called PICTCompressor floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it as it\'s even buggier.  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance) GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and ImageFX an impressive 24-bit image capture conversion editing painting effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro) from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPMGIFTarga formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM GIF Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink 31 7544 WJ Enschede The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software FREEPOST Cambridge UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group which I lead.  A package containing our source code documentation and some small test files is available from several places. The official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\'t forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format you may prefer ZIP format which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above) file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS) library 15 as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings see the FAQ article How to find sources referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in GIF PBMPLUS PPM/PGM Utah RLE and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although as with anything that\'s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\'d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join.   [7]  What\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs) but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re-quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm you\'re out of luck.  For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area) or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF one to display it) but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes etc.  For these people GIF is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offers much less compression.  At present very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component) you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end) while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10) followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEG-compressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8)     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM AT&T and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it (crop off a border say) and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss i.e. you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM RLE TIFF etc) while working on the image then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in section 3; in particular cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e. shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input but for GIF inputs Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it) a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don\'t know what all this is about read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didn\'t you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn\'t you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn\'t the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is \'Yes but what has it to  do with this package???\'  read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building saving loading (as resources) and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can\'t understand a word don\'t worry this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don\'t have to worry about that if you don\'t want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100\% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case wall two\'s rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I\'m also using Mode X 320x240).  I\'ve run into two problems; I\'m sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial but when I ran a packed->planar image through them I was dismayed by the jaggies.  I\'m now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?

Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (xyz) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\'t have to change size as they move about in the room).  I\'ve decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.

'I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.  Here is a short description and some technical information taken from the accompanying documentation:                                 DMPEG V1.0                         Public Domain MPEG decoder                             by Stefan Eckart   0. Features ===========  DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:    - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard    (IPB frames frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)   - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display   - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)   - several dithering options: ordered dither Floyd-Steinberg grayscale   - color-space selection   - runs under DOS 640KB RAM no MS-Windows required   - very compact (small code / small data models 16 bit arithmetic)   - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for    VGA and many Super-VGAs  ...  4. Technical information ========================  The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1]. The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2] (not quite the optimum I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great doesn\'t it?) which turned out to be faster than a \'fast\' algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors the (default) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image (I claim judge yourself).  Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.  Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color lying somewhere between the points of the display color space

' Hi It might be nice to know what\'s possible on different hard ware platforms. But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ). So I\'m not much interested in Amiga news.   In the case of Software I won\'t get any comercial software mentioned in this newgroup to run on a Unix- platform so I\'m not interested in this information.  I would suggest to split the group. I don\'t see the problem of cross-posting. Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size.   BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE TRAFFIC A LOT.  Sincerely

'I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program    an INTERACTIVE FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.    Besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc    bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs    such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.     The following is the relevant sections from the man page.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pre-Release of May 1993                                       BIT(1L)  NAME    bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations  DESCRIPTION   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.    As an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the   many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you (The   SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size.    As an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of   input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another.  In addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).    Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image.  FEATURES    Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report and once the processing is complete    the processed image will be displayed.    Current features include    o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing     and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color.    o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with     the option of subpixel sampling.    o Renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately such as into a PostScript file to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text     strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in TeX(1) e.g. $lpha$small$eta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.    o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.    o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms. Further the transformation can be applied to RGB channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it. Many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished     rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-     lability of graphical histograms of the image.    o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs) e.g. arrows circles trian-     gles etc. of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g     PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions     independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle).    o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-     to-1 transformation very accurate result can be obtained.    o Performs histogram equalization.    o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of     arbitrary order.    o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.    o Cuts and pastes across images.    o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.    o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images. (SlideShow)    o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities     or as an intensity vs. distance plot.    o Performs image type conversions.    o Converts image formats.    o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).    o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it.    o Modify an individual pixel\'s RGB values.    o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra.    o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).   SUPPORTED FORMATS       o  IRIS RGB native to SGI IRIS       o  JPEG(JFIF) format       o  CompuServ GIF       o  PNM(Portable Any Map) including PPM PGM and PBM.       o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)       o  TIFF       o  PostScript(Write only)  Hardware requirements: ---------------------------------------------------------------    Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode() including indigoes.  Where to get it: ---------------------------------------------------------------    anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z    where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73     Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking  Acknowledgement: ---------------------------------------------------------------    JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups\'s library Version 4.    FORMS library developed by Mark Overmars is used for GUI.    Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.  ---------------------------------------------------------------   Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate   images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of   your editing needs.

Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying I can\'t FTP could someone mail this to me?  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above with archie\'s help. Don\'t overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC\'s FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field   and having a line containing the word \'help\'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL send an original mail message not a reply.

Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News V4#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?)

'In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs. One is a C program that will perform a morph between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then it will write the points and the function (translate rotate etc.) out to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would let me do simple animation. However I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there  must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation

' PEXLIB and PHIGS (as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the PHIGS Programming Manual) are just different API\'s for the PEX protocol which is an extension to the X protocol.  So it depends on You what you go to use.  Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms (IBM GraPhigs  SunPhigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3D objects.  Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for immediate mode graphics

' I don\'t know the answer the to this one although with 8-bits I would assume that it was one or the other.   According to the literature
'  Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.  Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.  Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component) frame buffers. This set up called double buffering allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.   Well hey if you want to brag about numbers the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers) a 24 bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.  Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road  Manchester
' \tWhat\'s sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor\'s hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple DEC and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor\'s hardware.  Currently it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about dropping support for the Personal Iris DEC customers are pissed at DEC for dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes and Apple customers seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that\'s faster and cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer years ago I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386 and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.  \tWhat\'s really interesting is that from what I can tell the MIS folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don\'t seem to be pissed at IBM. Why?  I have no idea.  Either IBM really does take care of their customers better

'I currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any standard format.  They simply contain the 8-bit pixel values.  I would like to display these images on a PC.  The conversion to a GIF format would be helpful.  This conversion can take place either on a PC or on a UNIX system and I could then download it to the PC. Can anyone suggest where I can find software to do this?  Alternatively I may have to write my own conversion program.  In this case

Despite its small size and quickness   it has enough power to satisfy most users including:   standard x-y plots semilog plots log-log plots contour plots 3D plots   mesh plots bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or   different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each   graph.  Different line styles widths and colors are supported.  A virtually   infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are   almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four   different fonts the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical musical and   other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.   Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent)   including a portable metafile format and renderer.      Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on   hagar.ph.utexas.edu directory pub/plplot      At present (v. 4.13) PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:      Unix:   SunOS A/IX HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix   Other platforms: VMS Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT      Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display   enhancing smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   program with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering numerical analysis statistics etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs power spectra filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography   surveillance machine vision production testing biomedical imaging   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement histogram equalization spatial and   frequency filtering isolation of features thresholding mathematical   morphology analysis density measurement object counting sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 a pixel   depth of 8 16 or 32 bits and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT TIFF SATIE and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations spatial   linear and non-linear filters frequency filtering arithmetic and logic   operations and geometric transformations among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion dilation opening closing hole   removal object separation and extraction of skeletons among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects\' detection measurement and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area perimeter center of   gravity moment of inertia orientation length of relevant chords and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images noise removal making comparisons etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real  imaginary ) components or the (phase magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding eroding dilating and even   hole filling.    The program\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area   perimeter center of mass object counts and angle between points.    GTFS Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications   documentation and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing and contains the   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm   development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily   extensible through script (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types such as PICT2 and TIFF.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser pencil brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100\%   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast color balancing hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image   blur edges or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms including externally supplied compression such as JPEG   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF   EPSF TIFF PICT resource Amiga IFF/ILBM CompuServe GIF MacPaint   PIXAR PixelPaint Scitex CT TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color close   hues color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don\'t know...    Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus NJ 07653 201-845-6100  Dapple Systems --------------   High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to   work with multiple images enhance and edit and measure a variety of   global or feature parameters and interpret the data.    Dapple Systems 355 W. Olive Ave #100 Sunnyvale CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by painting it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator paint with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd. Suite J San Diego CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0  requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement 3D and contour plots image statistics supervised and   unsupervised classification PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose.    Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn\'t have all the inbuilt features of   other packages but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing programs for processing an image defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software.    Process Software Solutions PO Box 2110 Wollongong New South Wales   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: Laplacian medium noise filter etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF PICT EPSF or text (however EPSF files can\'t be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density shape size position or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes without the need for programming the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI the   program can find the distance between two edges the area of a shape   the thickness of a wall etc.  Image Analyst finds the center edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Its for IBM PC\'s or   clones cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not   as fast or as powerful though I have had only limited experience with   Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good   starter program except for the obtuse manual  IMAGINE-32 ----------   It\'s a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called Imagine32   or Image32 The program does a modest amount of image processing --add   subtract multiply divide display and plot an x or y cut across the image.   It can also display a number of images simultaneously.   The company is CompuScope in Santa Barbara CA.   PC Vista --------   It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to   be available from Mike Richmond whose email addresses have been  \trichmond@bllac.berkeley.edu \trichmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu    and his s-mail address is:    Michael RichmondAstronomy Department Campbell Hall Berkeley CA 94720    The latest version of PC-Vista version 1.7 includes not only the source   code and help files but also a complete set of executable programs and   a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code   you will need Microsoft C version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work   but will require substantial modifications.

Software distributed by 9-track Exabyte DAT   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103)   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits) and is   primarily for reduction analysis and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes particularly the Very Large Array (VLA) a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules and is   available for Suns IBM RS/6000 Dec/Ultrix Convex Cray (Unicos) and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx Solaris 2.1 and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - AIPS++ - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US Canada England the Netherlands India and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification classification (unsupervised and   supervised) intensity transformations three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\'s environments. Using   the Programmers environment utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables   colour stretches changes to histograms zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass   automatic navigation calibrate it to Albedo and Temp convert that to   byte register it to predesigned window all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of but it isn\'t that   difficult to write your own with their programmer\'s module.    Very small operation: one designs one codes one sells. Been around for   a number of years sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\'s Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics medical satellite engineering oil   exploration etc.).  It is called HIPS and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations filtering convolution Fourier and other transform   processing edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation digital   image compression and transmission  methods noise generation and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters\'\'.  It comes complete with source  code  on-line manual   pages and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible provides automatic documentation   of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax Sun Apollo  Masscomp  NCR Tower Iris IBM AT etc.   For image display and input drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors and the Sun-2 Sun-3 Sun- 4 and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx Sun   console Matrox VIP-1024 ITI IP-512 Lexidata  Macintosh II X   windowing system and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98\% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system  both as  an   interactive  research tool and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge) and comes with source code libraries a library of   convolu- tion masks and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats native formats of a number of CCD cameras and uncompressed binary   images in byte short integer and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s) all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale pseudocolor and random palettes is provided and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value polynomial of pixel value chs 1/x log    byteswap clip values at upper/lower limits short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean median mode or sum of pixel values with or    without autoscaling to mean median or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian Sobel edge operator directional gradient    line Gaussian elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters unsharp    masking median filters user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse rectangle    line gradient Gaussian and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding dark subtraction column over/underscan    bias removal remove bad pixels and column defects normalize to    region target mean median or modal value. o  create subimage mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data rename keywords plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry    brightness profile isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances area and luminance inside traced polygon.

'  I have a copy of \'The Earth-From Space\' on my wall that I purchased from Space Shots Inc. (LA CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the poster the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project. The image IS copyrighted so I doubt that you\'ll find it legally in the public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the  GeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing) and the cost is nominal so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also I don\'t think it\'s always safe to assume that just because the government \'funded\' a project any products will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA NOAA) and some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the GeoSphere Project.

' Speaking of SIGGRAPH I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night and was I ever grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!  For example:  \tSIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same \tthing a 127\% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the \tannual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite \twhich means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the \tproceedings and the art show catalog essentially.  \tTOPLAS went up 40\% in cost way outstripping the current inflation rate.  \tBasic SIGCHI fees remainded the same but whereas before SIGCHI \tmembership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings \tthese are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic \trate equivalent services have gone up 100\% in cost.  \tSIGOIS membership cost has up 33\% but they\'ve also split out the \tComputer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to \tbe included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG \talso has doubled its membership fee.  What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple like SIGGRAPH all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don\'t look so big.  But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90\% more than last year for a 31\% increase in services (measured by cost not by value) and curiously a 31\% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.  Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am? ________________________________________________________________________________ Robert Reed\t\t\tHome Animation Ltd.\t\t503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com\t5686 First Court West Linn

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress from January 8 1993 through April 30 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by anonymous FTP indefinitely.       The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican Library Archaeology Humanism Mathematics Music Medicine & Biology Nature Described A Wider World I: How the Orient Came to Rome and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process.       This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular but also to art historians historians of science or medicine early music scholars students of the humanist movement students of printing and the printed word theologians scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies and to librarians and information professionals.

'OK with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime the effects of scaling and so on I thought I\'d do some more tests.  First of all I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie there\'s a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames I digitized it at only 5 frames per second to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default 2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1 and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That\'s right I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S) and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0 but I don\'t think it\'s entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 1.0 and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course this will also improve the compression slightly

' I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).  Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.  This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.  \tGraeme Gill.  ########################################################################### A note on gamma correction and images  Author: Graeme W. Gill         graeme@labtam.oz.au  Date: 93/5/16   What is all this gamma stuff anyway ? --------------------------------------  Although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats (gif jpeg tiff etc etc) there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\'ve ever downloaded images from BBS or the net you\'ve probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light. Why is this ? you may ask. This is gamma correction (or the lack of it).  Why do we need gamma correction at all ? --------------------------------------  Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or un-gamma-corrected image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT you find that the CRT _doesn\'t_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this:  Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma  So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT the image will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want. So you have to do this to your image:  gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)  For most CRTs the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.  If that is all it is why does it seem so complicated ? -----------------------------------------------------  The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras or video signals in general). Because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are  rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those images with a program that doesn\'t do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT.  Whose fault is all this ? -----------------------  It is really three things. One is all those display programs out there that don\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is that most image formats don\'t specify a standard gamma or don\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gamma\'s.  At least two file formats do the right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).  Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.  [ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\'t provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls doesn\'t do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image. ]  How can I figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has ? ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution) which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and de-focus your eyes a bit.)  If your viewer doesn\'t do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center.  If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be around 2.2   [with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag and once you\'ve got it right you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile]  How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? -------------------------------------------------  This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear) although there are many about that have some gamma correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other.  If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light.  If your viewer doesn\'t do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok.  Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing -----------------------------------------------------  One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. This means images  could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance) if they used gamma correction. The implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level.  If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.  (I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance

'From article <1993May1.092058.1@aurora.alaska.edu> by pstlb@aurora.alaska.edu:   Since this was posted on comp.ai I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is what AI students do when they\'re really supposed to be doing something else e.g. thesis research & write up getting their supervisors\' pet programs to run properly etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking and no-one gets any money out of it. Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can or want to afford - particularly during a recession.  In addition over the last 10 years I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs. At a conference a year or two ago Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should \'Get back to the keyboard\' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I\'m inclined to agree.

'       Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error.  So I post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that.  So you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was I have misunderstood etc. Now you are saying:   If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a *lot* easier.  ----------------   Eh? Sorry I don\'t understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me.   Yes *as I originally said* global changes are easily possible.  But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:    ---------------    No I don\'t think so actually.   You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising) manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?   Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!   I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.   ??? What are you saying ???   Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem!!    Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.   Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however.   Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don\'t seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next. OK we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one through.    As I said in the last post JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.   Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette.  Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?   Look next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.   Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)  Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets you import other images. It shows I would say a good deal of thought about the human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for. It makes no false claims.   If you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them. So  far you have not done so.   Argh!! After all this a comment like that. `Very easily\'. OK go ahead and code it if it is so easy.  Or alternatively look up the terms `import\' and \'non-reversible transformation\'.   I think this is a bit of an exageration.  What you are actually saying is you got into a lift (elevator if you are in the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...   you bet   Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however it betrays some very wooly thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. Go think some more.  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road  Manchester

' Well yeah but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.  The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful options there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all TIFF files byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on all machines no matter what their natural byte order have to be prepared to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats -- again any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored by pixel or by component complexity without function etc etc.  I also note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus\' experiments show that LZW reliably compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats suggesting that none of the FAX formats are really useful.  What\'s worse a lot of the formats aren\'t even implemented very well e.g. LZW limits code words to 12 bits

First of all I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie there\'s a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames I digitized it at only    5 frames per second to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1 and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used    for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That\'s right I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S) and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0 but I don\'t think it\'s    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 1.0 and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course this will also    improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default I\'m not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is of course

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc. etc.  Conversely if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF for instance).  Thus using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years though 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images GIF is superior in image quality file size or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders overlaid text etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7 which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects then go up.  Except for experimental purposes never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale just high/medium/low-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don\'t know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources. (If you don\'t have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body.  The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful --- it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don\'t see what you want for your machine check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 2.21 also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll get only 8-bit color) nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version 2.5 is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50) file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version 1.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision 8.60a.  However CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20 that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117) which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway at least for previewing...  JView is freeware fairly fast has good on-line help and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment) but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version 0.9 is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84) file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware $20) displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above) file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register you\'ll get the 386-only version which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway the current version is 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows but only in full-screen mode not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.

Shareware $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6 you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92 this file contains QuickTime 1.5 which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format PICT/JPEG is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format PICT/JPEG format or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version 2.0 is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion though.)  Some people like this behavior some don\'t.  Overall JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse PictPixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie called PICTCompressor floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it as it\'s even buggier.  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance) GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and ImageFX an impressive 24-bit image capture conversion editing painting effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro) from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPMGIFTarga formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM GIF Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors try MGIF which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink 31 7544 WJ Enschede The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software FREEPOST Cambridge UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group which I lead.  A package containing our source code documentation and some small test files is available from several places. The official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\'t forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format you may prefer ZIP format which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above) file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS) library 15 as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings see the FAQ article How to find sources referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG JFIF format and image files in GIF PBMPLUS PPM/PGM Utah RLE and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although as with anything that\'s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\'d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join.   [7]  What\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs) but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re-quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm you\'re out of luck.  For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area) or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF one to display it) but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes etc.  For these people GIF is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offers much less compression.  At present very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component) you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end) while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10) followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEG-compressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8)     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM AT&T and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it (crop off a border say) and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss i.e. you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM RLE TIFF etc) while working on the image then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in section 3; in particular cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e. shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input but for GIF inputs Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it) a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular

'I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file format. I was looking thru it but I didn\'t get the idea how to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the whole image.  How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF?  How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale picture?  I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the filesize picture size and color resolution by analizing the header chunks. The output looks like this:    157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248C24  I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a similar tool for JFIF with an output like this:     57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     C24  Please respond by email because I don\'t read this news group very often.

'   Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs. Of course a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace.

I suspect I\'ll implement the display controller as a server process that  handles graphics requests queued on a mailbox one at a time.

'Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator\'s  \tContest Announcement)  WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?  ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer  peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that  uses simple low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to  a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads locators (Mice Trackballs Joysticks) printers VR  gloves digitizers sensors actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM Data Acquisition Simulation Virtual Reality  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games Education and many many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: =====================================  ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture based on I2C hardware  protocol with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol Base Protocol and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing  framing of bits into bytes and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards locators and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards

' Never claimed it is a bug.    Never claimed it is a bug.    I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups.  I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. This makes sense because the main use of XV is only viewing images.  Doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.    Never claimed it is a bug. I tried kept sure I don\'t claim that JPEG is noting else than a compression algorithm because I know what the JPEG is.

'  Whatever you do
'More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics workstations so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the E&S Freedom.   Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.  ------  Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors.  As a result Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity scalability and market penetration.  There remain however several important differences between the KPC and E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developer\'s dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility.  In its favor Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom systems include a large fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications.  Finally E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features however will remain much more flexible.  The KPC design team in contrast made Denali more of an end-user\'s system. Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations and come in at more realistic mainstream price points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one resulting in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide strong support for 3D imaging and volume rendering KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali\'s configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately and to upgrade them separately as needed.  Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI\'s more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance however Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications. Aside from being much more affordable KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules providing a lower-cost more scalable solution.  Hope this helps
'     First of all (this is NOT a snide response) if you\'re confused about this issue you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest that the weakness is your reference material.  Get An Introduction to Ray Tracing by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.      On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For example if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0 then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs but that\'s another issue =^).  So you get some illumination equation like this:          I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent      The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity as is the light due to transparency.  Now a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this:          I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt      That is each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka Kd Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object for example might be [0.4 0.1
'I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would like to have in your applications.    A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the  application.  It may let you  - manipulate application data the camera   3-D objects in the scene and so on or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects   via the widget\'s shape color position orientation and so on or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible.  For example a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback.  For example

For a more verbose explanation see any of the above references starting with:  The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes Computer Graphics book is certainly a good start.  Chapter 6 is Viewing in 3D then read chapter 15 Visible-Surface Determination.  For more information go to chapter 16 for shading chapter 19 for clipping and branch out from there.   3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.  Find a copy of Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display by Paul Heckbert SIGGRAPH \'82 Proceedings page 297.  There are other algorithms but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).  A variant method is described in Graphics Gems p. 287-293.  Note that the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site as described above.  Check out John Bradley\'s Diversity Algorithm which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual.  The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the other algorithms but slower.  There\'s also an implementation of:  Wan Wong and Prusinkiewicz _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_ Transactions on Mathematical Software Vol. 14 #2 (June 1988) pp. 153-162.  avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code in modified form appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.   4) Converting color into grayscale.  The NTSC formula is:      luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue   5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.  The only reference you need for this stuff is:      Digital Halftoning Robert Ulichney MIT Press 1987 ISBN 0-262-21009-6  But before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion.   6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.  The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source. This method is quite general and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling.  However there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface \'86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears in Graphics Gems (see section [1]) under the original title.   7) Free image manipulation software.  There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8 color -> gray gray -> b&w conversions. Here are pointers to some of them:      xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display manipulation and format     conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing     of GIF files among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file     contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for details on some.  Also the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this.  You may find useful information there.   8) Format documents for TIFF IFF BIFF NFF OFF FITS etc.  You almost certainly don\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.  These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. This archive includes pixel formats and two- and three-dimensional object formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.  A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently neither of these is complete you might want to check both.  FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It\'s a file format most often used in astronomy.  Despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.    9) Converting between vector formats.  A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript or MacDraw to CGM or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects -- circles ellipses drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.  There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The contributor states that it runs on Unix MS-Windows and possibly the Mac. A better more specific blurb would be most welcome.  On the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. As far as I know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive site.  A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format or HPGL to X11 bitmap.  For example some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\'s X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you\'re clever.  But in general the answer is no.  However if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial.  GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2).   10) How to get Pixar films.  The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:      Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price     Luxo Jr.\t\t\t\t$14.95\t\t\t$50.00     Red\'s Dream\t\t\t\t$19.95\t\t\t$75.00     Tin Toy\t\t\t\t$24.95\t\t\t$75.00     Knickknack\t\t\t\t$24.95\t\t\t$75.00     Luxo Jr./Red\'s Dream/Tin Toy\t$39.95\t\t\t$100.00  All tapes are on 1/2 VHS NTSC.

Also available:      Tin Toy T-shirt\t\t\t$15.00     Knickknack 3D T-shirt\t\t$15.00 (includes glasses)  For individual orders add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt $2 for each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders add $5 S&H for the first tape $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping add $3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international 213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify prices and availability.  Or just write to:      Direct Cinema Limited     1749 14th Street     Santa Monica CA 90404-4342  Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:  At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it\'s available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar\'s address).      Pixar     1001 West Cutting Blvd.     Richmond CA. 94804     (510) 236-4000      (510) 236-0388 (FAX)  You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains Luxo Jr. Red\'s Dream Tin Toy and Knicknack for $25.00 plus $2.50 for shipping. They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I  ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don\'t expect  to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case it cannot be rented.   11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?  The short answer is You can\'t.  Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to do the job right consult the article:    A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles   by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller   in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications volume 9 number 9   September 1989 pages 48-56.  For rough non-rational approximations consult the book:    Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture   by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt   Ellis Horwood Publishers Halsted Press John Wiley 1980.  For the best known non-rational approximations consult the article:    Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves   by Tor Dokken Morten Daehlen Tom Lyche and Knut Morken   in Computer Aided Geometric Design volume 7 numbers 1-4 (combined)   June 1990 pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]   12) How to order standards documents.  The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards and also ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900 mailing address is 1430 Broadway NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the complete name and number.  Some useful numbers to know:  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\'s Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.  Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179.   13) How to FTP by email.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix/fbm and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  In addition there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying help and it will tell you how to use it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.   14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.  Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\' article in Glassner\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information including treatment of special cases.  Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi the point is inside if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.  Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the Ray Tracing News Vol. 5 No. 3 available from princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.   15) How to tessellate a sphere.  One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The base of the recursion is an octahedron and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. It\'s available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.  16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.  Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:  Highlights of this edition-      i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through        November \'91;     ii) papers from all Siggraph Graphics Interface Eurographics CG         International and Ausgraph proceedings through December \'91;     iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;     iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;     v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.  The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long. Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It\'s named speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z and is compressed at most sites-               Site                             Dir \twuarchive.wustl.edu\tgraphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ \tkarazm.math.uh.edu\tpub/Graphics/ \tgondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au\tpub/papers/ \tnic.funet.fi\t\tpub/sci/papers/graphics \tcoral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/  Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies.  These are in refer format and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as RayBib.* and RadBib.*.  Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially in plaintext and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This collection is available at most of the sites above as rtabs.*.  17) SIGGRAPH information online  [from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]  ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org (128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.  The anonymous ftp service is very standard and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories.  To retrieve information by electronic mail send mail to      archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with the command      send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.   18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available  [from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]  ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH \'91 Panels Proceedings at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available in three formats:      text   (ASCII)      rtf    (rich text format suitable for many word processors)      word   (MS Word for the Macintosh) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:  (1) by anonymous ftp     change to one of the directories        publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]     The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode while the word     files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary      mode.      Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the     contents of each panel file.  (2) by electronic mail     send mail to        archive-server@siggraph.org     You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you     first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages        send panel91-txt index        send panel91-rtf index     in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary     information to retrieve the actual transcript files.   19) Graphics mailing lists  There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there each covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing.  Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats no software       (this is good IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).       Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.   21) What about GIF?  GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all) and in fact I don\'t like it much.  However it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.  Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.dalt.binaries.pictures.misc \talt.binaries.pictures.utilitiesalt.binaries.pictures.fractals \talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.dnews.answers  Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s) or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:  /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of:  send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Send a message containing help to get general information about the mail server.  Also you could check out the resources described in sections 7 8 and 20 above for more information.   22) What is morphing?  Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:          morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version many pictures - 1.5M)         morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)         m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)  The files are compressed so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards.   23) How to ray-trace height fields  Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses such as terrain rendering and some optimization is possible.  Thus they get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.  The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:  F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July 1988 <musg88.ps.Z>  This is available as Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639 from Yale University it\'s also in the SIGGRAPH \'91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes and (best of all) it\'s available on the net:      nic.funet.fi\t\tpub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z     weedeater.math.yale.edu\tpub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     princeton.edu\t\tpub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     coral.cs.jcu.edu.au\t\tgraphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z     gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU\tpub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z  An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

Pn not in the x-y plane is given by       Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |  where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal to P0.   25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH  Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM. Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00 Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)  SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00 $26.00 for Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions on Graphics) it\'s another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or Associate Members.  If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM it\'ll cost you $59.00 (no student discount).  There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.  ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet.  Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

' I posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary it was a complete technical description of the protocol. It can be ftped from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps   Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms. NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the same as X but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.  I\'m sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols so lets just implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing well thought out extensible protocol for online graphics so why not implement it.  If you need any advice on implementation just e-mail me. I am currently getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going on a freely available NAPLPS decoder then I intend to do it after I get a my conversion program out of beta

'I have posted DISP140.ZIP to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities. I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.  ******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use          if no fee is gained. ******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any          damage caused by this program.  Important changes since Version 1.35:   Added support for IRIS.   Support Mix/Concat. two images.   Added support for \'batch conversion\'.   Added support for \'load/save palette table\'.   Added support for \'edge enhance\'.   Added support for \'crop one line\'.   Added support for \'negate image\'.   New color quantization option.   Fix some minor bugs.  (1) Introduction:   This program can let you READ WRITE and DISPLAY images with different   formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION DITHERING ....)   on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different   formts.   Include simple file management system.   Support \'slide show\'. + Support \'batch conversion\'.   There is NO LIMIT on image size.   Currently this program supports 8 15 16 24 bits display.   If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor you must have VESA driver.   If you want to modify video driver please read section (8).   (2) Hardware Requirement:   PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.   min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).   (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).   Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).    The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.    Supported Wares:    * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)   * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping   * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768   * 80387   * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies   * VCPI programs such as QEMM DESQview and 386MAX    Unsupported:    * DPMI   * Microsoft Windows    Features: 80387 emulator 32-bit unix-ish environment flat memory   model SVGA graphics.   (3) Installation:   Video drivers emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.   (If you use Western Digital VGA chips read readme.wd)   (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible    with original version)   *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with       other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem       DON\'T put go32.exe within search path.    *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.    If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver add \'nc 256\' to environment     GO32.    For example go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256    If you don\'t have 80x87 add \'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387\' to environment GO32.    For example go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387    **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn et4000.grn and vesa.grn.                  Other drivers are not tested.               2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8 15 16 24 bits                  display. You don\'t need to use vesa driver.                  If et4000.grn doesn\'t work please try vesa.grn.               3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display                  please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits) grey scale b/w dither       and 24 bits image if allowed for that format.   (7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program you will enter \'read\' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy       files you will enter \'write\' menu. the \'write\' menu is much like       \'read\' menu but only allow you to change directory.       The header line in \'read\' menu includes (d:xxf:xxt:xx).         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in \'read\' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in \'read\' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First check magic number. If fail check         standard extension. Still fail report error.       pressing s or S in \'read\' menu will do \'Slide Show\'.         If delay time is 0 program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs program will make a beep. +       \'w\' or \'W\' to pause any key to continue.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in \'read\' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in \'read\' menu will quit program without prompting. +     pressing F5 will turn on \'effect\' menu.     2. Once image file is successfully read you will enter \'screen\' menu.       You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode press RETURN SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing LeftRight arrow: change display type. 8 15 16 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE you will enter \'write2\' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you \'original\' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you \'selected\' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8 15 16 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don\'t have enough memory      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM SUGGESTION      COMMENT about this program      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.

[ From Dr.Dobbs #198 March 1993: ]        The U.S. Defense Mapping Agency in cooperation with their counterpart agencies in CANADA the U.K. and Australia have released the Digital Chart of the World (DCW). This chart consists of over 1.5 gigabytes of reasonable quality vector data distributed on four CD-ROMS. .... includes coastlines rivers roads railrays airportscities towns spot elevations and depths and over 100000 place names.

If you need a standard for world cartographic data wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency\'s ONCs and will be available together with   searching and viewing software on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database mfil can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There\'s another program which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact you\'ll have to   compile just the libvplot routines not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions to information about soil types vegetation etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape 3480 cartridge 9-track tape   IBM PC floppy and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented not hobbyist oriented.  For more information   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 public domain tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions eg.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner like Epson\'s. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News Volume 4 #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don\'t have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp 1-619-536-9999 sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses such as Comstock   UNIPHOTO and Metro Image Base is available.    In Italy there\'s a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: \tEdition Belvedere Co. Ltd. \t00196 Rome Italy \tPiazzale Flaminio 19 \tTel. (06) 360-44-88 Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas) soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0 Imagine 1.1 and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing Andrew Glassner (ed.) Academic Press      1989 ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book but I feel that you can\'t be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There\'s a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda  UNC @ Chapel Hill: An Introduction to Ray Tracing in   Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw   NATO AS Vol. F-40. pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag 1988.  It contains code for a small but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_ David F. Rogers         McGraw-Hill New York 1985 pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  Displays on Display column of IEEE CG&A Jan \'87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell\'s teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep \'87 in Jim Blinn\'s column Jim Blinn\'s Corner describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects so you\'re advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here\'s a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex 146 4-vertex 7 5-vertex 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au  file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu   /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles\' model.  This model is stored in several files each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model\'s distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex 2268 4-vertex 33 5-vertex 14 6-vertex  10 7-vertex 8 8-vertex 8 12-vertex 2 13-vertex 2 15-vertex  17 16-vertex 2 17-vertex 2 18-vertex 3 19-vertex 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs Stanford University for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles but even if your image isn\'t normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\'m not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. \'ice\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\'s a PostScript-based   graphical editorand it\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it\'s an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I\'ve heard of besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\'m not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\'ve   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\'s a   freebie if you want it    My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well also. Personally I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica Igor or even   Excel on the Mac if it\'s not too hairy) then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn\'t handle and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way it\'s mostly astronomical   image processing which I\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement   cleaning up bad lines/pixels and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then for example taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons scrollbars    menus and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation image display and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it\'s public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly compared to Macintosh software. A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering full color on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based has some image-processing capability   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best of course for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software as   well as bug fixes contributed sources documentation and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   tar archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions support concerns miscellaneous questions etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips tricks and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions problems or comments send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip mirror rotate generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass low pass edge enhancing median   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI Inc. out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada makes   an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats: LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS Unix   workstations (among them HP Sun and IBM) and VMS and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The PCI software consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI   database disk file.  The Tape I/O package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO or write those formats out FROM the PCI database file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis equalization user-specified operations (e.g.   multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5) and   God only knows what all else -- there\'s a LOT.  I don\'t have and don\'t   use these so can\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from   a common parameter file which must be (in VMS anyway) in your default   directory.  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\'s   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images but   requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls raw) data from tape in a number of different   interleave orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry\'s CT2T format would probably (I haven\'t tried)   handle Targa and so on. Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It\'s worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to   contain not only raster (image) data but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table) land-use and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude   longitude time date etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI database).    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be overkill   in your case; it seems designed for the very high end   applications/users i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\'t suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\'s   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification classification PC and   IHS transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays).   Actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR an executive based on TAE and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\'re interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF   TIN DEM Lattices

' No MIS folks have infinite budgets of death and they also get parts of their budget allocated upgrades maintenance and new purchases and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually leases and so is the software.  Basically the engineers who have tight budgets i.e. the coders and designers of a company bitch and moan when they drop 15000 on a  Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types upgrade once every 5-10 years and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting payroll etc.  Now if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts
'FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE            The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24           in Orlando Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-           laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-           GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-           tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was           represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS           users workstation vendors third-party PHIGS implementors stan-           dards  committee  members  and  researchers  from  industry  and           academia.  The opening speaker Dr. Richard Puk challenged PHIGS           users  to  take  charge of your PHIGS by participating in PHIGS           standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS           implementors.    The   closing  speaker  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam           described his vision of the future of graphics standards  beyond           PHIGS.            Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following           topics:  PHIGS  and  X Application Toolkits Application Issues           Texture Mapping NURBS  PHIGS  Extensions  and  Object-Oriented           Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX PHIGS           Non-Retained Data Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS  and           Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed           a good forum for exchange of ideas needs and experiences.   The           conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-           ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools           based on PHIGS.            Next year\'s conference is planned for March 1994.            PHIGS EVERYWHERE            At the conference PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated           PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers from PCs to           mainframes.            Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including           conditional traversal composite logical input devices texturing           and translucency.            Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO  the  Photo-           Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add           advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API with features like           ray   tracing  materials  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.           Radiosity support is also planned.            FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging           graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate           mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL  HP  Starbase           and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.            TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph a  powerful           2-call  charting  system  based on PHIGS+ and FIGt an object-           oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.            G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on           Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer 1993 Ver-           sion 3.0 of GPHIGS the company\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-           tions  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS           developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS           internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data           Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS           for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition G5G described           their application GSE that allows application callback  functions           during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE G5G\'s data visual-           izer and application development toolkit are currently available           on  all  major  workstations  that support GL X Windows PEX or           Starbase.            Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows           and ARENA a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most           of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many           advanced  rendering features like texture mapping shadow genera-           tion area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS           or ARENA is available on request.            ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-           tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most           workstation platforms with C FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-           porates PEX support.            Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center Digital           Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the           DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs\' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.           DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with           support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most           GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as           proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and           the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340           workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.            Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A           Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics           PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-           ments.             PHIGS USER GROUP            The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS           applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and           PHIGS standards bodies.

'The OTIS Project presents...         SYNERGY: Revolt  \t...the first in a continuing series of collaborative \tart initiatives designed to exploit the binarity \tof the infosphere.  This series of diversely  \tstructured art-manipulation projects will attempt \tto stretch across network boundries encouraging \tuse of electronic mail fax video photography \tscanned conventional art and even sound to  \tcreate multi-artist still visuals in GIF and  \tJPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels \tare welcome.    \tREVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be  \tthree stages of production.  The first stage will \tconsist of all participants creating one still  \twork as a starter piece that two other partici- \tpants will in turn manipulate.  All first stage \tbase images are due by Sunday May 23rd 1993  \tmidnight Central Daylight Time.   \tStage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will  \tbe sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant \tfor them to do manipulations on in anyway they see  \tfit.  For purely digital artists this may consist \tof filtering the image through their favorite paint \tprogram.  For analog artists this may well be \tprinting a hardcopy of the image and adding their \town part with pen pencil or white-out then scan- \tning in the image again to be transferred on to  \tthe third-stage artist.  All second-stage works \tare due by midnight on Sunday May 30th.  \tStage three is the finishing stage and will begin \ton May 31st.  All artists will do what they think  \tit takes to finish up the image they\'ve been given \tusing whatever technique they see as worthy.   \tThese images will be due on June 6th midnight.  \tAll involved will participate in each stage of \tcreation.  \t----------------------------------------------------------- \tTo join send email/mail with the following info:  \tName: \temail address: \tmail address: \tscanner access?

'I\'m looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is the following;  From a fast source eg. a CDROM several sound sources are read each having it\'s own defined position and other attributes eg. direction etc.  Given the listeners position and direction the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it\'s incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some reflection diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation

'I\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering that I\'ve encountered in 2 different PEX implementations.  I can\'t find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ Gaskins\'s _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_ vendors\' documentation).  I\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated Z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this it\'s a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates) compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically it\'s worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  I\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers

'     Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model the RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster.

'Okay I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven\'t actually used one or seen one so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I\'d like to see an independent review of one against say an SGI Indigo Extreme or something.  Basically the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DEC\'s ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are binary compatible with Digital\'s OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali is their graphics subsystem which is upgradable in the field by simply adding transformation engines.

'molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.   While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing.   This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources including video recording equipment.

'Howdy all    Hmm... 48 bit aye? Well it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance. 48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour. The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it as 65536 possible shades of pure red. This might actually make some sense since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours)  may produce visible \'jumps\' in intensity.

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of natural real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\'t quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren\'t perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc. etc.  Conversely if you aren\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly you\'ll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF for instance).  Thus using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years though 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore for reasons detailed in section 7 JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images GIF is superior in image quality file size or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of realistic scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\'t have 24-bit display hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders overlaid text etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that\'s only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text don\'t JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7 which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF you\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you\'ll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments  ship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits \t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish a lot you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif \t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color \t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original \t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) \t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this \t\t\t from the original even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 \t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look \t\t\t for you could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many \t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 \t\t\t JPEG\'s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent \t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). \t\t\t Still I\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were \t\t\t of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) \t\t\t Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or \t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: \t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that\'s a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good quality settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95\% of the information as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it\'s not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects then go up.  Except for experimental purposes never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art.  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don\'t even provide a numeric scale just high/medium/low-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don\'t know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources. (If you don\'t have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources in the body.  The Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful --- it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don\'t see what you want for your machine check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version 2.21 also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\'ll get only 8-bit color) nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version 2.5 is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50) file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy but it\'s functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview.  The current version 1.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach but there\'s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\'t have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver so don\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but I don\'t know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision 8.60a.  However CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\'d have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\'t get *any* of them to work you\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware don\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular you can\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below) file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\'s key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) msdos/graphics at Simtel20 that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>.  If you are not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117) which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics.  If you have no FTP capability you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware due to Windows\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it\'s so fast you\'ll use it anyway at least for previewing...  JView is freeware fairly fast has good on-line help and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\'t create new JPEG files and it doesn\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment) but it\'s an excellent basic viewer.  The current version 0.9 is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84) file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware $20) displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above) file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register you\'ll get the 386-only version which is roughly 25\% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway the current version is 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows but only in full-screen mode not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\'s JPEG implementation which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\'re running System 6 you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92 this file contains QuickTime 1.5 which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format PICT/JPEG is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format PICT/JPEG format or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version 2.0 is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact it\'s the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion though.)  Some people like this behavior some don\'t.  Overall JPEGView\'s user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\'s tool and it\'s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse PictPixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie called PICTCompressor floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it as it\'s even buggier.  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw so really old machines can\'t use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to \'JPEG\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance) GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don\'t want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to \'JPEG\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It\'s cheap (shareware $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04 available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you\'re willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and ImageFX an impressive 24-bit image capture conversion editing painting effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro) from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPMGIFTarga formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it\'s stored on; if you have such a program trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM GIF Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors try MGIF which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink 31 7544 WJ Enschede The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software FREEPOST Cambridge UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized so it\'s hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\'ll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else\'s files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group which I lead.

Most people don\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called color quantization.  (This is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term.  We\'re stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally because of this effect it\'s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as 256-color JPEG.  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs) but number of colors just isn\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don\'t have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\'re stuck with the sender\'s quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re-quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore if the sender didn\'t use a high-quality color quantization algorithm you\'re out of luck.  For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don\'t match the sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\'s display hardware.  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area) or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF you\'re stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF one to display it) but often it\'s also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color PC displays true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes etc.  For these people GIF is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article\'s long enough already so I\'m not going to say more than that here.  For technical information see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offers much less compression.  At present very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial.  Saying -Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component) you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end) while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) a low-end format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a high-end format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\'s QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read it\'s likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10) followed by \'JFIF\'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a     raw JPEG file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it\'s worth a try anyway.  3.  HSI files start with \'hsi1\'.  You\'re out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they     won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEG-compressed will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \'JFIF\').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it\'s a proprietary format or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8)     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is  \tbegin line \tM_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with  \tbegin line \tM:\'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM AT&T and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn\'t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it (crop off a border say) and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss i.e. you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least not with the current free JPEG software.  It\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you\'re wondering why it\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but that\'s a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don\'t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM RLE TIFF etc) while working on the image then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from it\'s far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in section 3; in particular cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e. shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (ghost edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system XV\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input but for GIF inputs Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you\'d get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it) a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try -smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don\'t want.  If you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However cjpeg\'s built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image you\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular

The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.  I was plugged-in at the time (i.e. not using the battery) but I still tried switching the battery changing the power-saver features etc. etc. all to no avail.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I\'ll have to but I thought that the death of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened.  I didn\'t want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they\'ll say: Yep you gotta have this replaced and it\'s gonna cost you $???.

'Hello
'   Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many \'similar\' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  Having done this you need to do something to them ... what exactly?  Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd.  So in summary what I said in my previous posting still holds:    In other words to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.  As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV.

'  Yup.  Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right).  I can\'t remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG\'s to GIF\'s before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards. You don\'t need any special hardware to view JPEG\'s except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086 8088). I have a 8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIF\'s and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering my way gives a brighter more detailed image.

' I suppose you don\'t know what about we have discussed. We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway and I didn\'t tried to solve them at all because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There\'s no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.    Ok you\'re writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesn\'t work because there\'s no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature but I don\'t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen there\'s need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don\'t see full 24bit image there\'s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok I don\'t have thought very much 24bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...    It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same. So XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So even all screen images are 8bit the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes I may as well make a lift where \'up\' means that the lift goes down and \'down\' means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn\'t solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :)   Well my text may be a bit hard reading

'Dear Netters:   I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a  concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know  that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both   ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists  public domain source code for this.      Another \'rough\' solition (don\'t care special cases) is ray-casting  which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces  consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used (M. Tamminen et. al. 1984. Ray-casting and block model conversion using a spatial index. Computer-Aided-Designs. 4 1984 60-65). But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ? I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case.      I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden line removal. It says if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing  toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra.... Again how to make sure ?      Any pointers are welcome ?

'  Yes.  Here\'s what you should do.  Keep the vertices in an array and have the polygons (triangles are okay but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you don\'t have to transform any vertex more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don\'t have to be transformed at all.  Whenever you transform a vertex check if it\'s on the far side of the hither plane; if it is

'    Certainly. Reference follows.   Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind. One protanopia is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones those that respond best to long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.  The other deuteranopia is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected.  Unlike protanopia reds are not dimmer than  normal.  On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point. For protanopia the point is at u\'=0.61v\'=0.51 very close to the far red corner. For deuteranopia the point is at u\'=-4.75 v\'=1.31  Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup random errors and so on. The values quoted are typical.  So if all colours on a line are seen as the same which colour is actually seen?  This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is very similar  joining 477nm and 579nm.  *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia:  1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4) This is the new chromaticity.   The best reference for this is Meyer G.W. & Greenberg D.P. (1988) \'Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays\' IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5) 28-40.  You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.   Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on and the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured or obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago.  The procedure for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a help here.)  A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. B) retaining the Y component for later convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u\'v\' using u\' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z) v\' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D) find the intersection as in step 3 E) convert back from u\'v\' to XYZ using the Y value from step A F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable.   Done; also posted for the rest of us.  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road  Manchester

' \tThe first and only thing I\'ve ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline very irregular but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines (not only lattitude and longitude but loran grids as well).  The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say no dummy you\'re going the wrong way.  \tSteve Reisberg a friend of mine a few years back(*) did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool.  \tIn some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step but a step on which all future analysis depended.  However in other respects it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight clean and well imaged; you don\'t always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images.  In any case it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case.  \t(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.

The subjects are  \t1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in assembly which I don\'t know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?  \t2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will tell me in mostly plain english how the vesa calls work.  \tMy biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books I have asked graphics professors I have hunted the net through both gopher and archie I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks I know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where are you
'   [Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.]  In reverse order:  1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you look carefully.  2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette entries or do global colour changes; crop scale etc. Clearly the program must save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it saves out 8 bit images - of course!  XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy facility not a bug.  How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group \'related\' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated.  If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.  And lastly JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth. Again this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space ;-)  Later  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road  Manchester

Put the following on a gopher server:         Type=1        Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu        Port=70        Path=        Name=Gopher Software Distribution.         Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu port 70 and      look in the gopher directory.        There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.      The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine      consultant.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more      information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client      software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A      client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse      scroll bars etc.)  A local client is also faster.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to      in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?  A3:  Here is a short list use the site closest to you to minimize      network lag.       Telnet Public Logins:       Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area      ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------      consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4\tgopher  North America      gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America      panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201\tpanda   North America      gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe      info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia      gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden      tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America      ecnet.ec\t\t           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador      gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan        It is recommended that you run the client software instead of      logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the      custom features of the local machine (mouse scroll bars etc.)      and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive printing a file      to a local printer viewing images retrieving files from ftp      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?  A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University      of Minnesota Microcomputer Workstation Networks Center to help      our campus find answers to their computer questions.         It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information      System used by a large number of sites in the world.       Many people have contributed to the project too numerous to      count.        The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu or via paper mail:           Internet Gopher Developers       100 Union St. SE #190       Minneapolis MN 55455  USA       Or via FAX at:         +1 (612) 625-6817  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS WWW ftp)?  A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.      As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:               - Search local WAIS indices.        - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?  A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :       _The_Whole_Internet_ Ed Kroll O\'Reilly 1992 (Editors note:                              ..Great book go out and buy a bunch!)       _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet\'s Guide to Our World Online      By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to       Computerized Archives.       veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles      in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives veronica       is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher      items each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.      Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client it is easy      to use and gives access to all types of data supported by the      gopher protocol.       To try veronica select it from the Other Gophers menu on       Minnesota\'s gopher server or point your gopher at:       Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)       Type=1       Port=70       Path=1/veronica       Host=futique.scs.unr.edu  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q8: What is Available for Biology?

'Hello I have some problem in converting tga file(generated by POVray) to rle file. When I convert I do not get any warning message. But if I use xloadimage/getx11 something is wrong.  Error messages are \% targatorle -o o.rle data.tga \% xloadimage o.rle o.rle is a 0x0 24 bit RLE image with no map (will dither to 8 bits) with gamma of 1.00   Dithering image...done   Building XImage...done xloadimage: X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) on 0x0 xloadimage: X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) on 0xb00003 ......

'I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures which can be nicely eliminated by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images but now I would like to automate the procedure.  The problem is that XV can\'t (I think) convert images automatically and the obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don\'t even get close to XV\'s quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB even though the images are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the public domain? If so
' I use Arts & Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences it traces beautifully. BUT - there\'s a trick to tracing. I\'ve traced entire cartoon images into custom clip art but you can\'t expect to just point to the image and get it just like that it takes a little work (in some cases a lot of work). You need to trace a drawing piece by piece and then put it  together... it\'s kinda hard to explain in type

'  We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\'t seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100100100) (100200100) (200200100) (200100100)       Polygon 2: (125125100) (125175100) (175175100) (175125100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting
' Well GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme (LZW?).  IFF is not really a graphics format but rather a standard way to package images sounds animations text or whatever into one file.  IFF was created by Electronic Arts I do believe (I could be wrong)

' \tActually for digital HDTV systems that\'s far higher bandwidth than you need unless there\'s some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV.  Also my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I\'m guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600 I\'m fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).  \tI hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.  \tUnless you have a _very_ compelling reason I\'d advise trying to use at least somewhat compressed data.  You don\'t have to go to full compression to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier to deal with.  --  GNU Emacs is a LISP operating system disguised as a word processor.  - Doug Mohney

The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:     :hacker: [originally someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.      1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most      users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who      programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A      person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is      good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program      or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \'a UNIX      hacker\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated and people who      fit them congregate.)  6. An expert o
